Workspace for text analytics relevant to the Antarctic environment.

The project had three main facets:
1) Extracting a clean text stream from legacy documents
2) Recognising mentions of species and locations within a document
3) Matching species and loactions mentions and modelling which pairs repesented a genuine species-was-found-at-location relationship

Notebooks contained in this repo and which step they belong to:
 ExtractingText.ipynb (1)
 GeoNames.ipynb (2) (intermediate preparation of GeoNames data)
 RecognisingSpeciesAndLocations.ipynb (2)
 NER Metrics and Matrix Creation.ipynb (2, 3)
 FeatureEngineering.ipynb (3)
 Building Models.ipynb (3)
 Visualisation.ipynb (reporting)

Due to time and scope, step was was paused and steps 2 and 3 were progressed using clean text streams copied directly from the docuemnts in the training set.
