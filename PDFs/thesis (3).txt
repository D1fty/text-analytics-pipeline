A Thesis   submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the Degree of Master of Science in Biological Sciences at The University of Waikato   ‘Wie Site selie kin: rah te aie sate Sle: ae University of Waikato | 1990Dedication For Mike and Jan who have always provided stimulus and encouragement for my ideas.iil   The biota, comprising the bryophyte flushes on continental Antarctica, are specialized organisms adapted to the rigorous conditions imposed on them by the environment. Ice free areas of continental Antarctica provide the few habitats suitable for colonization by plants and invertebrates. The presence of free water and certain climatic conditions are essential features. This report investigates bryophyte flushes in two ice free areas in Southern Victoria Land. The first is within the Lake Fryxell Site of Special Scientific Interest No.12 adjacent to the Canada Glacier in the Taylor Valley, one of the so called Dry Valleys. The second is at Granite Harbour approximately sixty kilometres north of the Taylor Valley site. The purpose of this investigation was to ascertain plant and invertebrate species present at these sites and to obtain some measure of their distribution and abundance. Clim:   itic data are presented for the period of the study. At the Canada Glacier site, plant associations were mapped in detail and biomass and nutrient values were calculated. Numerous counts of invertebrates were recorded from cores of plant material. Qn the main flush, sites which had been damaged by sampling in the past were located. These were mapped, and described, envisaging that these will be important reference sites to monitor the ability of these flushes to recover from physical damage. At Granite Harbour a qualitative investigation of plantsiv and invertebrates was carried out. Comprehensive plant species lists have been compiled from the Canada Glacier and Granite Harbour areas. The different prevailing conditions for plant growth at the two sites are emphasised by the differences in numbers of species found. Biomass figures from the Taylor Valley compare favourably with figures presented for lower latitudes of the Antarctic region. The plant species list from Granite Harbour is exceptional in its extent for a site of this latitude. Invertebrate groups have been recorded for both sites. Counts of - individuals from the Taylor Valley provide estimates of abundance which compare in number to estimates from maritime Antarctic locations. It is concluded that the bryophyte flushes at the Lake Fryxell Site of Special Scientific Interest (S.S.8.D are areas of relatively high biomass, with | community patterning closely linked to the water regime of the area. They are likely to have a low annual net production and a low capacity for recolonization. This is the largest area of bryophyte growth reported for the Dry Valley region and as such should play an important role in consideration of future impacts and studies in the area. This summary of biota, present at the Canada Glacier bryophyte flushes stands as the only collective record of these parameters to date for this area. The production of these data is the first necessary step to enable further monitoring and conservation to be carried out.| Acknowledgements Thanks are due to Waikato University and Antarctic Division D.8.I.R. for making this opportunity available to me.

They are fragile in the sense that they have small capacity to absorb change without being profoundly altered and hence are potentially likely to suffer from impact (Report: IUCN/SCAR 1986). As the Antarctic is still less affected by human activities than other parts of the world, conservation programmes can start nearer the natural baseline than they would elsewhere. There is increased world interest in the expansion of tourism and exploitation of marine species and mineral resources. In order to avoid recurrences of uncontrolled exploitation that have repeatedly occurred elsewhere in the world, long-term conservation relying on effective | base-line studies is essential (Report: IUCN/SCAR 1986). The area of the Antarctic continent is about 14 000 000 square kilometres, comprising one tenth of the land surface of the earth. Of this, less than 3% is ever free of permanent snow and ice (Fig. 1.1). Over 50% of the continent is higher than 2000m with 25% being more than 3000 m.a.s.l. The 3% of ice free ground is made up of exposed nunataks, permanent ice free areas, and areas that become free of snow during the summer melt period (Laws 1984).2 The ice free areas of continental Antarctica were described as oases by A. Stephenson in 1936 (Pickard 1986). The term was included in western literature during the United States Navy ’Operation Highjump’ in 1947 (Byrd 1947). The current theory on the formation and maintenance of oases, as reviewed by Pickard (1986) is that they formed as a result of the unusual orography of the terrain, combined with climate changes toward a general warming. Two essential conditions are suggested for the formation of an oasis. There must be a relatively high block of land with a retreating or thinning ice sheet. As the ice sheet lowers, the outward flow of ice is no longer over the block but around it. Ice above the block continues to lower but as it is not replenished, the rock is exposed. The cause of the lowering of the ice sheet is linked to global phenomena and the general holocene trend to warmer temperatures. Ice free areas are maintained by the low albedo of the exposed rock leading to a positive radiation balance. This warms the rocks which act as a heat source to melt any precipitation which is not blown away by wind. These oases then, are areas where temperatures can rise above freezing during the Antarctic summer, and consequently are places where plant and invertebrate life are to be found (Pickard 1986). The general weather pattern for continental Antarctica is short cold summers followed by very long winters. Surface wind direction and strength is closely related to the direction and steepness of terrain. Katabatic winds draining the surface air of the interior are especially noticeable near the coast (Laws 1984).‘ i W~ Stillwell Hills   names Ross Dependency Figure 1.1: Map of the Antarctic continent with coastal oases highlighted.Various zones with distinctive climatic and biotic features have been described for the Antarctic. Holdgate (1970) describes four zones, the southern cold temperate, subantarctic, maritime or oceanic Antarctic, and continental Antarctic. Continental Antarctic has no phanerogamic vegetation and is considered south of the limit of extensive closed cryptogam communities (Holdgate 1970). Laws (1984) reviews the zonations described in the literature from 1904 to 1982 and in conclusion presents the same divisions with similar descriptive criteria, based primarily on the vegetation. In Laws’ (1984) classification continental Antarctica is further subdivided: a. Coastal continental Antarctica is described as semi-desert with moss and algal vegetation present on ahumic soil but restricted in species and extent. Lichens are numerous and locally form extensive stands. Liverworts are very rare and invertebrates are locally abundant and diverse. This definition includes the coastal fringes of the continent and the ice free areas such as the Dry Valleys, of southern Victoria Land (Vincent 1988). b. Slope continental Antarctica is desert with mainly open, discontinuous lichen vegetation with occasional moss patches near rare snow. Some invertebrates are found. c. Ice plateau continental Antarctica is described as having no life besides micro-organisms and stray birds (Laws 1984, Longton 1988).I:IIt Antarctic Terrestrial Flora | Mosses and lichens dominate the Antarctic terrestrial macroflora (Laws 1984). Until recently taxonomic confusion has clouded the biogeographical status of many cryptogamic taxa. This is especially so on continental Antarctica where collection by specialists has been restricted to comparatively few areas. The bryophyte flora of Antarctica is comprised of some 70 mosses and 10 hepatic species. The majority of these are confined to the maritime Antarctic compared to which continental Antarctica is impoverished, with only six genera of mosses having been confirmed. These are Bryum, Ceratadon, Grimmia, Plagiothecium (one aquatic record), Pottia and Sarconeurum (Seppelt 1984). Bryum is the most widespread and abundant genus in the flora and arguably the most variable in morphology. More species have been reported in this than any other genus (Seppelt and Kanda 1986). . As latitude increases, the vegetation becomes sparser with fewer species and a comparatively smaller range of community types in a given area (Holdgate 1970, Laws 1984). Sporadic occurrences have been noted on some of the most southerly rock exposures 84° 35’ S and 86° 09’ S respectively (Laws 1984, Wise and Gressit 1965). An important factor determining bryophyte distribution in the Antarctic is adaptation to low temperature conditions. Mosses and lichens show stress resistance to temperature extremes and water deficiency, and have an ability ‘for rapid reactivation of photosynthesis without a lag phase when conditions are suitable (Kallio and Kidrenlampi 1975). These characteristics are especially6 relevant to Antarctic bryophytes which are effectively freeze dried during the winter period. Two other important factors have an effect on the terrestrial biota of all south polar regions. Geographical isolation from potential source of propagules and cool summers, reduce the survival potential of species which do manage to achieve the necessary ocean crossing (Laws 1984). The distribution of plants in the severe climatic regime of the Antarctic has been summarised by Holdgate (1970) as being dependant on a degree of shelter, a northerly aspect, adequate water supply in the growing season, direct solar radiation and a stable substratum. Pickard (1986) suggests the distribution of plants on continental Antarctica is limited by the suitability of ice free niches and the availability of liquid water for growth during summer. The poikilohydric water economy of mosses restricts the season of photosynthetic activity, and therefore productivity. Because of these | constraints, in continental Antarctica, mosses are only very locally abundant by lakes, streams, glaciers and snow banks which melt gradually throughout the summer, They occur less extensively in hollows where blowing snow accumulates (Longton 1988). Steam warmed ground on Mt. Melbourne has also been recorded as supporting moss growth (Broady 1984, Broady et al. 1987a). Itis claimed that these discrete plant communities have low reproductive capacities and slow recovery rates. Consequently their ability to recolonise is small. For these reasons the habitats and their inhabitants are highly © susceptible to the activities of humans (Greene et al. 1967).7 Broadscale mapping and description of vegetation has been carried out for a few locations in continental Antarctica. Sites where more detailed studies have occurred are listed by Given (1988). These are Yule Bay and Lillie Glacier, Cape Hallet, Terra Nova Bay and Wood Bay, Ross Island, Dry Valleys, Blue Glacier and Garwood Valley. In addition Given (1988) suggests reasons why © the Ross Dependency may hold particular botanical interest. These include the unique habitats of the Dry Valleys, the development of vegetation on geothermally heated soils, the wide range of rock types and suitable plant sites, and the relative accessibility of the dependency. I:1ll Antarctic Terrestrial fauna There are no true terrestrial vertebrates in Antarctica and the macroscopic fauna is therefore dominated by arthropods. Microscopic invertebrates dominate in areas which are seasonally free of snow cover (Laws 1984). Dougherty and Harris (1963),in one of the earliest modern investigations into freshwater microfauna, describe the multicellular microfauna in freshwater bodies of Ross Island and the nearby continental coast of Victoria Land as having thriving populations of rotifera, nematoda, tardigrada and turbelleria (platyhelminthes). Laws (1984) reviews relevant literature up to 1982 on terrestrial invertebrates in Antarctica. He lists the main groups of species which have been identified from continental Antarctica as protozoa, rotifera, nematoda, tardigrada and arthropoda. Not included in this list are8. platyhelminthes which do not appear to have been reported in continental Antarctica since Dougherty and Harris (1963). Since these earliest reports the focus of terrestrial invertebrate studies has been on the arthropods, particularly in the maritime Antarctic. The interactions between arthropods and plants has been investigated in the maritime Antarctic zone (Block 1985, Booth and Usher 1984, Usher and Booth 1984, 1986), but similar investigations on continental Antarctica are fewer in number. Pickard (1986), reviews recent developments in terrestrial invertebrate studies in the Vestfold Hills and Miller et al. (1988) studied the terrestrial tardigrada inhabiting algae, lichens and mosses in the Vestfold Hills. Everitt (1981) noted rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes, protozoans and bacteria associated with algal mats in Deep Lake Tarn in the Vestfold Hills. Suren (1989) studied microfauna associated with meltpools of the Ross Ice Shelf. Corresponding maritime studies for freshwater ecosystems are reported | by McInnes and Ellis-Evans (1987, 1988). Nematode species have been described from the McMurdo Sound region (Timm 1971, Wharton and Brown 1989).I:IV Coastal oases Ice free areas of coastal continental Antarctica are not only the areas where relatively abundant plants and invertebrates are found but are also the regions which receive the major attention in terms of tourism, exploration and modern scientific expeditions. Two oases in coastal, continental East Antarctica, which have been the focus of biological studies, are the Vestfold Hills in Princess Elizabeth Land, and the Dry Valleys in southern Victoria Land, Ross dependency (Fig. 1.1). - The Dry Valleys encompass an area of about 5000 square kilometres with a maximum elevation of greater than 2000 m. The valleys are large features in the Transantarctic Mountains, one of the largest mountain ranges on earth. In contrast the Vestfold Hills, at a latitude of around 68° 35’S, are a smaller area of lower lying ground, termed a low coastal oasis (Pickard 1986). A substantial amount of biological research has been completed in the Dry Valley area and the Vestfold Hills. While the topography and the latitude of the Vestfold Hills vary markedly from the Dry Valleys it is convenient to make comparisons between these two oases. © The importance of free water associated with warmer temperatures for plant growth has been emphasised (Pickard 1986, Laws 1984) and this condition is met in the Dry Valleys by melt water streams which are characterized by a highly variable flow regime at diel, seasonal and annual timescales (Vincent and Howard-Williams 1986).10 In winter, plants in the Dry Valleys become freeze-dried’ and therefore only poikilohydric plants such as mosses, lichens and terrestrial algae form the Dry Valley communities. Thompson (1980) listed the type of plant growth that could be found in the Dry Valleys. He classified them as edaphics (mainly algae), sublithics (including Bryum antarcticum and Buellia frigida), epilithic, chasmolithic and endolithic lichens. Cryptoendolithic lichens have been described as the dominant form of life in the Dry Valley region by Friedmann (1982) who suggests that algae and lichens are the only terrestrial plants found in the Dry Valleys. In contrast Green (1986) states that bryophytes are the most abundant terrestrial plants _where water is available. Although it is widely known to scientists who have visited the area, that mosses can be locally abundant, literature on the presence and distribution of mosses in the Dry Valleys is scarce. Mosses have been reported from the Taylor Valley (Greenfield and Wilson 1981, Green 1986), and from a variety of places in the Garwood Valley near the ~Howchin and Joyce glaciers (Broady et al.1987b). Water flushed areas on valley slopes, channels of melt streams and areas below glacier ice cliffs supported these growths. I:V Sites of Special Scientific Interest Within the Ross Dependency a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (S.S.S.I.) have been designated. These are in place to provide a measure of protection to certain areas, while permitting research to be carried out under specific management plans. Hence associated ecosystems and11 organisms are actively conserved and/or other forms of research where permitted by the management plans are facilitated. There are three such areas within the Dry Valleys. These are in the Asgaard Range, Barwick Valley and the Taylor Valley. The Taylor Valley (Fig. 1.2), | generally lies in an east-west direction. The Taylor Glacier enters the head of the valley and numerous other glaciers flow over the north and south facing slopes. The S.8.S.I1. in the valley encompasses an area of 1km sq between the tongue of the Canada glacier and the shoreline of Lake Fryxell (Fig. 1:3) and is termed 8.S.S.I. number 12 (New Zealand Antarctic Operations Manual 1989). During the summer months small meltwater streams drain from the glacier to the lake creating an extensive area of flushes. Much of the meltwater first drains into the Canada Pond adjacent to a low lying area of the glacier edge. The pond is frozen to the bottom in winter but thaws completely during the summer of most years. The S.S.S.I. was designated to protect an area of some of the richest algal and moss growth so far found in the Dry Valleys. The site is considered the centre for terrestrial and freshwater biological research and a reference site for other Dry Valley biological ecosystems (New Zealand Antarctic Operations Manual 1989). The area encompassed by the S.S.S.I. has come under review during the summer of 1989/90. The New Zealand Antarctic ResearchProgramme hut was sited within the 8.8.5.1. and Antarctic Division D.S.I.R. requested that comment be made, by our expedition, on the huts relocation. The result was that the hut was moved during November 1989, and new boundaries were proposed to include a164° E ' N | Granite —” ~Y Harbour | Ross Sea <0" — (fc. Roberts 77°SKO C.

IVIL Objectives of the study The fieldwork for this study was carried out in the Antarctic from 14.11.89 to 11.12.89. In view of the fragility of these ecosystems care was taken to minimise our impact by keeping sampling to a minimum, and to restrict movement within the area to strictly defined paths. Subsequent laboratory analysis of samples was conducted at Waikato University in the early part of 1990. The study was completed at the Taupo Research Laboratory, D.S.I.R., Taupo, New Zealand. The areas investigated were the Canada Glacier / Lake Fryxell bryophyte flushes in the Taylor Valley and the area of Cape Geology, Botany Bay and the Flatiron at Granite Harbour (Fig. 1.2).. The first was the major focus of the _ study and therefore received greater attention to detail (objectives 1 to 4). The observations at Granite Harbour are a result of a qualitative survey of the area spanning two and a half days (objective 5).15 The objectives of the study were: To determine the locations of the plant communities, their community structure, floristic composition, biomass and nutrient status. The 1989 study of plants in §.S.8.I. No.12 focused on obtaining a definitive species list as identifications have not been confirmed from the location before. To determine the invertebrate groups present, their abundance and to ascertain how invertebrate occurrence was related to vegetation - community types. To determine relationships between community composition (plants and invertebrates) and environmental factors, in particular topography and water. To assess the capacity of these ecosystems to recover from external disturbances. To compile a plant species list from Granite Harbour and to describe how the composition of communities at this site compared to that of the Canada Glacier/ Lake Fryxell $.8.S.I. flushes.16 Chapter II: Study Sites, Materials and methods. II:I Taylor Valley: Site Description and Climate. The areas of bryophyte growth, which were the focus of the majority of this thesis, were located in §.5.S.I. No. 12 adjacent to the eastern face of the Canada Glacier (77° 38’ S,163° 00’ E), in the Taylor Valley approximately 12 km from the sea . The Canada Glacier is a local alpine glacier as distinct from the large outlet glaciers draining the polar ice sheet, or a coastal piedmont glacier lying along the coastline. The smaller alpine glaciers are all dry based. These dry based glaciers are effectively incapable of basal erosion and flow slowly as there is no basal sliding. Chinn (1986) presented evidence that the Canada glacier had been advancing over the previous five or six years. There are 3 main flow directions of water off the Canada Glacier during the Antarctic summer and it is associated with these flows that the main plant growth is found. The occurrence of wet algal-rich spongy flushes adjacent to the foot of a glacier where streams form is a frequent occurrence in the Dry Valley area (Howard-Williams and Vincent 1986). The flush areas at the Canada Glacier can be described as ’short turf. These are systems formed by sparingly branched acrocarpous mosses with main shoots erect and parallel. The colonies may be loose or more frequently compact, greater than 2cm tall and often composed of Bryum and Pottia (Longton 1988).17 Two main areas of plant growth were identified for this study and were termed the ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ flush (Fig. 2.1). The lower flush is included in the present boundaries of the S.S.S.I.. Its source stream runs in a north east direction off the face of the glacier toward the Canada Pond and contributes to the Fryxell stream. The area we termed the lower flush was that delimited by the extent of plant growth. It was approximately 130 metres long and 55 metres wide. The main stream flowing on to the flush divided in two, 45 metres downstream from the glacier, and rejoined 30 metres further down narrowing to a 10 metre wide strip draining into the Canada Pond (Photograph 1). In the summer of 1989/90 the amount of water flowing over the plants increased as the melt progressed, and eventually many of the bryophytes in lower lying areas were completely submerged (Photograph 2). The upper flush is included in the revised 8.8.8.1. boundaries. Water is supplied to this area from a few hundred metres length of the upper north facing edge of the Canada Glacier. This is the beginning of the Fryxell stream which rapidly increases in size along the first kilometre as streams contribute from various portions of the glacier (Howard-Williams et al. 1986). The Fryxell stream is one of three which dominate the hydraulic budget of the receiving waters of Lake Fryxell (Green et al. 1989). Water which is sourced from the glacier and flows over the plants in the flushes, is likely to be the major source of nutrients to the system (Downes et al. 1986).18   upper flush Figure 2.1; Expanded view of upper and lower flushes. The outlines are determined by the limits of visible plant growth.19 Photograph 1. Overall view of the lower flush looking south.20 Photograph 2. Submerged Pottia heimii21 Howard-Williams et al. (1986) measured nutrients in the upper and lower part of the Fryxell stream during January 1984, and noted that inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations decreased markedly downstream. It was concluded that the significant algal growths in the area stripped nutrients from the water flowing over them. The Dry Valleys’ warm temperatures and persistent up and down valley winds help keep the area substantially free of snow in summer. The winters are characterised by long periods of cool calm weather interspersed with periods of warm, westerly katabatic gales (Vincent 1988). Polar microclimates are greatly affected by wind and the paucity of shelter for plants and animals limits their distribution. There are three primary wind effects. These are disturbance of local temperature and humidity profiles, abrasion damage by transport of ice and mineral particles, and transport of living propagules (Laws 1984). In the Antarctic all terrestrial plants and micro-organisms live close to the ground. The special microclimate at this level in relationship to air temperature at higher levels is illustrated in Figure 2.2. An overall higher temperature for moss and lichen surfaces is evident compared to air temperatures at 0.6 metres and 1.5 metres. At 5.S.S.I. No.12 a number of factors combine to provide a suitable microclimate for plant growth.

Figure 2.2: Daily maximum temperatures at four levels at Air .6M seers Cape Hallet from Greene et al. (1967). GG23 reduces abrasion of the plants, warm summer temperatures are attained at moss level and water is available from glacial melt. Extreme cold is the major feature of Antarctic environments. Even throughout the summer air temperatures at the margin of the continent lie between -10 and 15° celsius (Vincent 1988). Since 1985 continuous records of meterological data have been collected from within five kilometres of the study site at the Canada glacier. The meterological station is situated at Lake Hoare on the edge of a small peninsula 300m west of the Canada Glacier (Clow et al. 1988). In the year preceding this study daily average temperatures were above zero only within December 1988 and January 1989. They fell to below -40° celsius at times between May and August 1989 (Fig. 2.3). Relative humidity showed little change in overall trend throughout the year, fluctuating between extremes of approximately 30 and 80% (Fig. 2.4). For approzimately four months of the year the site is subject to continual darkness (Fig. 2.5). With the return of sunlight during the summer months a diurnal cycle in photosynthetic quantum flux is evident. Throughout the year air temperature closely follows incident sunlight. Meltwater stream ecosystems in the Dry Valleys are fundamentally linked to radiation and temperature. There is a strong correlation between mean daily discharge and the seasonal radiation cycle. Many streams show pronounced diel variations that depend on the position of the sun relative to the melting glacier faceTemperature ( degrees c.) oO wm s So 9 9 > pb od 0 ja iego Time (days) (Day 1460 = January 1 1989) Figure 2.3: Daily average temperatures at Lake Hoare from December 1988 to December 1989 (McKay, unpublished data).

As a consequence small shifts in energy balance at glacier ice faces may markedly alter the availability of water for biota in these ecosystems. As water flow off the glacier is affected by changes in incident radiation, : _ itis consequently extremely variable on all scales from hours to years. Figures from the Onyx River in the Wright Valley illustrate variations in discharge related to changes in the radiation balance at the glacier face and emphasise the variability in annual discharge between years (Fig. 2.6). It follows that plant communities might provide an integrated assessment of water reliability and volume in an area, because of their reliance on this water for growth. II:II Site Description and climate, Granite Harbour Granite Harbour is located at 77° 00’ S, 162° 50’ E (Fig. 1.2). Ice free areas on the coast provide suitable habitats for plants and invertebrate colonisation (Fig. 2.7). Granite Harbour was named by Scotts party in January 1902. The area was noted as being well protected from the wind and enclosed by much bare rock capable of absorbing the suns’ rays. Small streams of water were described as meandering over stones with banks of almost luxurious mosses in their sheltered courses (Murray 1929). Coloured lichens, ’good sized’ clumps of ’real’ green moss, and plentiful collembola were noted in Edward Wilsons’ diary (Savours 1966). On November 30, 1911, the western geological party from the Terra Nova came to a small sheltered beach east of Cape Geology.162°°30°E       ice free 0 1 2km areas Lt    Figure 2.7:.Map showing location of Cape Bay at Granite Harbour.    ee a s *+*       * * * * ct * * * #,t = + * + Haystack Mountain eology and Botany Wilson Piedmont Glacier   6630 Because of the lichens and moss which they found growing here in ’some abundance’ they named it’ Botany Bay (Quartermain 1967). During this expedition they constructed a kitchen of granite blocks roofed with a sledge, biscuit boxes and sealskins. Much of this (including the sealskins) remains today (photograph 3). During our visit in 1989 we noted that the north facing sites of Cape Geology and Botany Bay are fed by numerous streams running down the steep granite faces. The streams are fed by part of the Wilson-Piedmont glacier above and are possibly enriched by the presence of a skua rookery. Ryan and Watkins (1989) concluded that nutrients in ornithogenic products had direct causal effects on the abundance and dispersion of the biota of inland Antarctic nunataks. Plant growth at this site contrasted with that at the Canada Glacier in that there was no well defined flush area and the plants grew amongst granite boulders. On Cape Geology most plant growth was found in the narrow catchments of the streams or on granite ledges where snowmelt and windblown deposits provided the water and substrate necessary for growth. In Botany Bay a comparatively wider area of less steep slope next to the sea allowed water from the streams to spread out amongst the boulders creating an expanse of suitable habitats extending approximately 50 to 100 metres along the beach. Mosses and lichens have been collected in the past from the Granite Harbour region. These have been identified as Bryum argenteum Hedw. , B. antarcticum Hook.f et Wils., Sarconeurum glaciale (C. Mull.) Card. et Bryhn,31 Photograph 3. Scotts kitchen at Granite Harbour.32 Lecanora griseomarginata, Rinodina frigida and Usnea antarctica. Algae of the genera Prasiola, Zygnema, Navicula, Nostoc and Phormidium have also been reported (Ugolini 1977). Climatic conditions in the Granite Harbour region have been inferred from meteorological stations at other sites in the McMurdo region. Ugolini (1977) estimated from isotherms delineating the area, that the mean annual temperature for the Kar Plateau on the north side of Granite Harbour is probably between 20.0 and - 25° celsius. He judged from the amount of snow on the ground in October 1969 that the precipitation is probably higher than for other ice free areas of Southern Victoria Land. The Kar Plateau has an average elevation of 600 metres and as such is substantially higher than our study site which was within 100 metres of sea level. Air temperatures for 1924 November 1969 fluctuated between -8 and +2° celsius, and for 24-26 October 1969 from -10 to -80° celsius (Ugolini 197 D. Records kept by two New Zealand research parties in the Granite Harbour region over the summer of 1983/1984 note a range of temperatures from -14° celsius on October 11 to -2° celsius on December 4. These readings were usually taken between 0700 and 1000 hours. A maximum windspeed of 30 knots was recorded on one day in early October. Wind speeds were otherwise generally less than 10 knots (Pyne 1984).33 II:10I Methods If:1II:I Microclimate on the Canada Glacier Bryophyte flush. A Campbell CR21 datalogger was set up on the lower bryophyte flush with three probes attached to it. These logged continuously at fifteen minute intervals for just over three weeks. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR 400-700nm) was measured with a LI 190sb quantum sensor to an accuracy of 0.1 uM m-?/sec. The logger was programmed to record maximum, minimum and average P.A.R. over the preceding fifteen minutes. A combination temperature and humidity probe was placed at 4 cm above the moss bed and another temperature probe was pushed lcm into the moss. Relative humidity was measured to 0.1% and temperature to 0.1° celsius. The response of the humidity sensor is such that only trends can be taken from the data. Absolute values can be several % in error. Air temperature and moss temperatures were also measured using a hand held ‘Fluke’ digital thermometer over 4 diel periods at two hourly intervals during November and December 1989. The air temperature was measured at approximately 10 cm above the moss. The temperatures within a bed of Bryum argenteum (for sites see Fig. 2.8) were measured at depths of 5, 10 and 15 mm.@p Biomass and W nutrients f Diel temperature v measurements Frozen ground transects    Figure 2.8: Lower flush map showing sites for nutrient and biomass samples, transects for measurement of frozen ground and sites for measurement of moss temperature.35 IHG Frozen ground. On 3 days during November and December (17.11, 24.11, 8.12) the depth of frozen ground was estimated on three transects spanning the lower flush (Fig. 2.8). This was measured by pushing a steel measuring rod into the ground until it could be pushed no further. Care was taken to detect fake readings from buried rocks. Is:0T Plant Taxonomy There is considerable confusion surrounding the taxonomy of the bryophytes of continental Antarctica. Bryum is both the largest genus and the one that raises the most taxonomic questions. It is considered that only through taxonomic revision and controlled environment growth studies will the number of moss species in continental Antarctica be clarified (Seppelt 1983). Previous records from the Canada Glacier bryophyte flushes reported Bryum argenteum and Bryum antarcticum (Green 1986) but recently the identification of Bryum antarcticum has come under review ( Kanda 1981, Seppelt and Kanda 1986). We were fortunate to have Rod Seppelt from the Australian Antarctic Division with us who has wide experience in the taxonomy 7 of Antarctic bryophytes. His identification of bryophytes in the field enabled us to compile a species list in light of recent taxonomic reviews. ILHLIV Vegetation of the lower flush (Initial mapping). Collections of representative plant specimens were made from both the lower and upper flushes. The lower flush was mapped by establishing a five36 metre grid. A survey line was established on the western side of the flush and measuring tapes run perpendicular to it, across the flush, at five metre intervals. The elevations along the survey line and across the flush were measured with a builders theodolite. This was also used to ensure that lateral tapes were at right angles to the main survey line. The boundaries of major plant associations were drawn and a visual estimation of cover made within these boundaries. An overall map was produced at a scale of 1:100. IL:I0:V Verification of cover estimates To establish the accuracy of the visual cover estimates, point quadrats were examined at a number of areas over the flush. A quadrat 10cm x 20cm divided into lcm squares was subjectively sited on the flush to cover the range of vegetation perceived to be present. At each cm intersect within the quadrat the plant species was noted. Within each community type between 2 and 10 quadrats were investigated. The % cover of each species in each quadrat, and the mean % cover within each plant community was derived from these figures. Transects were laid across the main flow channel at five locations on the lower flush. The microtopography of these transects was mapped using a theodolite. The heights were not surveyed with regard to a standard reference point but their relationship to the overall contours of the flush is illustrated in the results section. The height of the ground and the plant species present were noted at five cm intervals along the transect. The data from the transects was subsequently divided into 20 cm intervals for the purpose of analysis. Each of these intervals was regarded as a site, and chi squared analysis was37 carried out to determine a degree of association between plant species. Each site was designated as a hummock or a hollow from the topographic survey data. IL:1TT:VI Nutrients For each of Pottia, B. argenteum and Nostoc associations, 5 x 1 cm diameter cores were taken from 3 different sites (Fig. 2.8) to be used for nutrient analysis. A stainless steel cork borer was used to core to the depth where the plant material met the substratum. This was to a depth of approximately 15 mm for the mosses but less for the algae. The cores were placed in glass vials and kept frozen until they were dried after return to New Zealand prior to analysis. To obtain the minimum required weight for this analysis, the 5 core samples were bulked. Nutrient analysis was carried out by the Plant Analysis Laboratory, M.A.F., Hamilton. Nitrogen and phosphorus were analyzed using a Kjeldahl digest with selenium as a catalyst. Nitrogen was analyzed by a modified Gehrke-Wall automated method, while phosphorus was analyzed by an automated method using an ammonium molybdenate and amino napthal sulphuric acid reaction. The remaining nutrients were analyzed using a nitricperchloric mixed acid, wet ashing procedure. The digests were diluted with strontium chloride solution to inhibit the formation of stable calcium and magnesium phosphates, sulphates and aluminates in the flame. These diluted solutions were then analyzed on a four channel flame spectrophotometer using atomic absorbtion for the magnesium channel and flame emission for sodium, potassium and calcium.38 Il:T01:VII Biomass To obtain an estimate of the biomass of the plants an additional set of cores was taken adjacent to the first set. Each individual core was dried for 1 week at 50° celsius and then weighed. Many of the samples had a high sand content so for all the samples ash free dry weights were calculated. The samples were placed in a furnace for 2 hours at 550° celsius. After cooling in a desiccator the material remaining after ashing was weighed on an OHAUS GT480 digital balance. This weight was subtracted from the initial dry weight to obtain an estimate of the above ground biomass. The results were extrapolated to biomass/unit area assuming continuous cover (Longton 1988). . No distinction was made between green and decaying material. I:WI:VMI Vegetation of the Upper flush The upper flush was mapped on a broad scale to compare the vegetation with that of the lower flush. 45 transects were placed across the flush at 10m intervals starting at the Canada pond and working northward. The major boundaries of plant groups were marked at each 10m interval. Percent covers were not estimated due to the great variability on this large scale. I::IX Epilithic Lichen Mapping At the outwash area of the Canada Pond, an area containing epilithic lichens was discovered. Lichen distribution was mapped in relation to water depth using a similar method to that used for the lower flush. Two parallel39 30 m tapes were laid out in a line with the river flow and enclosing the entire outwash area. Two further 30 m tapes were then placed across the stream at a distance of one metre apart. The number of lichens could be counted in each one metre square by moving along the tapes. When each transect had been completed the upper tape was lifted and moved downstream, one metre below the remaining tape, and the assessment proceedure repeated. A total distance of 15 m was mapped along the stream. A microtopographic survey was also made. Lichens were recorded by an abundance index fully explained in the results section. IL:TII:X Recovery To obtain a measure of the ability of the lower flush to recover from damage we relocated plant and animal sampling sites which were still recognizable after a period of 10 years. Damage was initially located by careful observations of the flush. Sites were marked on a site map and where possible, were then surveyed enabling a scale map to be produced. A simple map available from 1980 allowed old paths to be relocated on the flush whilst small cairns indicated sampling sites. Excluding paths and footprints, a total of nineteen damaged sites were identified and, of these, nine were confirmed as to type and date of damage.40 IL:T1:XI Invertebrates | Samples for invertebrate enumeration were taken from the lower flush by the coring method described for the plant samples. These cores were placed in ’whirl-paks’ (NASCO Ltd) and kept frozen until they were examined. Invertebrate numbers were recorded from samples taken in November before the melt began. Animals were not active within the flush at this time and these counts are therefore an indication of the potential inoculum which would become active as soon as water was available. Numbers were also recorded from samples taken after meltwater had been on the flush for 14 days (8-10.12.89). Abundances per square metre were calculated from 27 pre-melt lem diameter cores and 17 vost-melt cores. Most of the samples were counted in the field but some were retained frozen and transported back to New Zealand. For invertebrate enumeration the cores were sectioned into 3 layers, 5 mm thick, wetted and left at approximately 2° celsius for 1 hour before counting. While in the field initial counts were made at intervals for a 24 hour - period to establish a minimum time to leave the sample before counting. A time course plot of invertebrate numbers (Fig. 2.9) was used to determine the minimum period required to maintain a sample in the wetted state before counting the invertebrates in this and all subsequent experiments. One hour was decided on as there was little change in numbers of active invertebrates over the following time period up to 24 hours. In practice the time varied between one and two hours as some samples were more time consuming than - others to count.41        J | Sample a. | . fF eee ee | | Sample b. |   “| “ Wetting period chosen Number of active invertebrates on Time (hours) Figure 2.9: Invertebrate counts over time following wetting of a freeze dried moss core.42 The small size of the samples made it possible to count the total number of animals in each core by teasing apart the plant material, in a thin layer of water. This was done in a channelled perspex counting tray (channel width 10 mm). Animals which were visibly moving were counted under a disacctine microscope (x50). Ii:ITi:XII Granite Harbour Investigations at Granite Harbour were carried out from. 4.12.89 to 7.12.89. Representative plant samples were taken from Geology bay, Botany bay and from the Flatiron. The plants were identified to obtain a species list and invertebrates were extracted in the same manner as described for Fryxell samples. No quantitative analysis of invertebrate numbers was attempted here. One stream eatchment was surveyed | in relative detail as to plant composition. The area lies on what could be termed the boundary between Geology bay and Botany bay. The catchment was drawn to scale and a visual impression of changing plant species composition was noted from the snow bank at the highest point down to the ocean. Physical characteristics were noted. Samples were taken at 6 sites in this area to be examined for the presence of invertebrates.A3 Chapter III: Climate and microclimate: Lake Fryxell area. TIT:1 Introduction: It is accepted that in the Antarctic microclimate zones occur close to the ground which may be crucial to the existence of biota. It is considered that in 5.9.9.1. No.12, a number of factors associated with the Canada Glacier combine to provide a favourable microclimate to enable the continuation of plant growth in the area. In order to describe microclimate characteristics close to the ground on the lower flush, air temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation were measured over the entire study period. The depth of frozen ground was measured on three occasions and moss temperature was measured over four diel periods. This chapter presents results from microclimate observations on the lower flush adjacent to the Canada Glacier during November and December 1989. Tit:It Re   sults IIT:T:1 Climate Temperature recordings at 4 cm above the moss for a 15 day period from 24.11.89 to 10.12 89, are illustrated in Figure 3.1. An obvious diel variation is evident with a trend to increased average temperatures in December. TheTemperature (degrees c.) 15 107 2400 hours Time (days) (Day 9 = November 24 1989) Figure 3.1: Air temperature at 4cm above the moss on the lower flush. ; _ TT a nr ae? VV45 temperature experienced at this level over the monitored period was -9 ° celsius with a maximum of 13.5 ° celsius. Temperature fluctuations are illustrated in Figure 3.2 over four diel periods. A consistent diel fluctuation is evident with an obvious increase in average temperature as the summer progresses. During the hours of 2200 and 0400 when the air temperature drops to the lowest level of the diel period, moss temperature consistently remains higher than air temperature. The capacity of the moss to buffer against air temperature changes means that during these diel study periods the mosses had a higher average temperature overall than the air temperature. As the water flow increased over the flush, temperature differences which had been observed at different depths within the moss, ceased to be obvious. Figure 3.3 shows the relative humidity (R.H.) at moss level for the period 24.11.89 to 10.12.89. While the moisture content of the air close to plant communities has been little studied, data in the literature all show increasing moisture gradients down toward the ground with R.H. maxima usually occurring at night (Laws 1984). R.H. maxima at night are evident from Figure 3.3. Higher R.H. due to lower temperatures is evident on comparison of Figures 3.1 and 3.3 around the 27th November (day 12) and the 7th December (day 22).

Comparison of Figure 3.4 (datalogger) and Figures 3.2 c and d (diels) illustrates the relationship between P.A.R. and temperature. The first ‘period of 28/29 November was a clear day and although this was early in the summer before water was flowing over the whole flush, moss temperatures reached more than 12° celsius on the afternoon of the 29th (Fig. 3.2). P.A.R. levels reached a maximum of 1500 1M m-? s-1. In comparison the period of 7/8 December was a partially overcast day with a maximum P.A.R. of 1720 pM m-? s-1. By this part of the summer moss temperatures were often around 0 ° celsius and meltwater covered the flush for much of the day, but the lower overall light levels appear to have precluded the maximum temperature exceeding 9° celsius. A significant increase in air and moss temperature over the course of the day can be seen between 15/16.11.89 and 22/23.11.89 (Fig. 3.2) at which stage meltwater became visible on the flush itself (Fig. 3.5 and photograph 4). Over the following week the amount of water flowing onto the flush waxed and waned as temperatures fluctuated above and below zero, and with cloudy and clear skies, but by the 7th of December water was flowing over the entire flush. This correlates to extended periods when the air temperature remained above zero. Water level at the site of transects 1, 2, 3 and 5 on the 10.12.89 is shown on the transect profiles illustrated in chapter IV.50 OF oe roe, fi 4} tf (64 if 4 ~ == 23.11.89 w—e 24-25.11.89 a—+ 5.12.89 Complete cover 7.12.89   ie \ onowene 0 2 O | . eo ' o* . .o* a a oF por oo | go> oem rae Figure 3.5: Changes in the wetting front observed on the lower flush in the early stages of glacial meltwater flow.ol Photograph 4. Meltwater appearing on the lower flush (23.11.89).52 IIT:IL:IE Frozen ground An effect of increasing soil temperature on the flush is the increase in depth of substrate to the frozen ground layer (Fig. 3.6). A general pattern of deepening of the frozen ground layer can be observed. This deepening of the frozen layer would imply an additional source of water being available to the plants as more water entered the liquid state. The large increase in depth between 24 .11 .89 and 8 .12 .89 (Fig. 3:6 ) corresponds to increasing air temperatures (Fig. 3:1) and the associated increased amount of free water flowing over the flush.Depth (mm), i Oo © Oo   = 3 3B 35 ——; Distance (m) Figure 3.6: A representative transect illustrating the change in depth of frozen ground across the whole flush.o4 Chapter IV: Vegetation: Lake Fryxell S.S.S.1./Canada Glacier IV:I Introduction Two areas of plant growth adjacent to the Canada Glacier were investigated during this study. A bryophyte species list was compiled and the presence of algae was noted. The distribution of plants in areas such as the Dry Valleys is highly dependent on the availability of water during the summer season. In light of this, the patterning of plant species in relation to water flow was analyzed in detail on the lower flush, and investigated on a broad scale on the upper flush. In this chapter vegetation maps of both areas are presented, accompanied by a detailed analysis of species composition and percent cover on the lower flush. Results from analysis of biomass and nutrient content are included. The presence of lichens at this relatively low altitude site is noted with a description of their distribution in relation to water level in the Fryxell stream. IV:II Results IV:II:I Plant Species This section outlines plant species described from flush areas adjacent to the eastern edge of the Canada Glacier.D5 MOSSES Bryum argenteum Hedw. Bryum pseudotriquetrum (Hedw.) Gaertn. Pottia heimii (Hedw.) Feurnr. B. argenteum is one of the few truly cosmopolitan moss species. Seppelt (1984) notes that many Antarctic specimens tend to lack the characteristic silvery-green colour of the leaf tips, however achlorophyllous leaf tips were evident on the Fryxell specimens. It was noted that in the freeze dried state, patches of B. argenteum turf had lifted away from the substrate over the winter period. This is the first record for Bryum pseudotriqutrum from this area although it is considered to be widespread in the Antarctic region (Seppelt and Kanda 1986). The plants occurred scattered amongst the B. argenteum. Seppelt (1986) notes that B. pseudotriquetrum is widely scattered in the eastern half of the Vestfold Hills but that extensive beds are uncommon. Seppelt (1984) considers B. pseudotriquetrum to be synonymous with B. algens.56 Pottia heimii has been referred to in the past as B. antarcticum. Records of B. antarcticum are now considered to be synonymous with P. heimii (Kanda 1981). P. heimii can be divided into two growth forms. The first is healthy looking moss growing adjacent to channelled areas or where there is available seepage water. The second type is termed ’encrusted’ Pottia. This has a dry unhealthy appearance due to salt precipitation on the surface. Vincent (1988) reports that Antarctic soils have an unusually high salt content which may include calcium sulphate which often occurs as_ surface encrustations. Greenfield and Wilson (1981) collected freeze dried mosses from ‘Cape Bird which were encrusted with a white crystalline deposit. This was found, on analysis, to contain 35 % sodium, 0.4 % magnesium, 2.2 % potassium and 0.3 % calcium. They suggest this is probably wind blown salt, deposited on snow cover and further deposited on these mosses by evaporation. The accumulation of soluble salts is a feature of desert regions in which evaporation exceeds precipitation and where soils are not flushed by meltwater. This implies that these encrusted Pottia areas only receive water by percolation up from the sediment below . LICHENS Sarcogyne sp. Caloplaca citrina (Hoffm.)Th. Fr.Oo” Carbonea capsulata (Dodge and Baker) Hale comb.nov. Lecanora expectans Darb. These were noted in a small area near the outflow of the Canada Pond and identified by Dr. Rod Seppelt. ALGAE Broady (1981) has described the algal communities which are an important component of the flora of the study area. He labelled the algal growths within the flush as "hydroterrestrial"” due to the alternating wet and dry moisture relations. Three general communities were recognised by us in mapping and analysis of plant communities. These were a) Nostoc commune which forms large macroscopic mucilaginous colonies in wetter areas of the flush. Oscillatorian algae are associated. b) Red brown felt in the region of maximum and most frequent water flow. This is dominated by Oscillatorian algae. c) Eipiphytic algae over the surface of Bryum argenteum and Pottia hami. These are dominated by Nostoc but include several Oscillatorian algae and Calothrix in wetter Bryum argenteum areas (Broady 1981).58 IV:II:II Initial mapping. Patterning of plant species is easily seen visually on the flush. Within the main channels of water flow Nostoc communities and associated Oscillatorian sp. dominate (Broady 1981). Bryum argenteum is found in areas of flowing water and seepage areas. Where water is flowing a high proportion of this moss has epiphytic Nostoc communities associated with it. Moving out to the edges of the flowing water zones or to higher ground Pottia heimit dominates. Figure 4.1 is the initial map of the lower flush showing obvious community boundaries. It was within these boundaries that estimates of % cover were made. Because subjective assessment of plant abundance contains a very large error, it will only give an approximate indication of abundance (Kershaw 1964). To avoid placing too much emphasis on this visual estimation the cover percentages were bulked into areas of >5 % cover to give a visual picture of distribution. Figure 4.2 illustrates the distribution of Nostoc colonies (not associated with bryophytes) (overlay 1), Bryum argenteum (>5 % cover) (overlay 2) and Pottia heimii (>5 % cover) (overlay 3). Bryum pseudotriquetrum is included with B. argenteum. The maps overlay a general contour map of the flush on which the main lines of water flow are indicated (Fig. 4.3).

These give an indication of species composition within the broad cover estimates and suggest that the bulking of cover estimates into areas of >5% is an accurate indication of percent cover. The histograms drawn from Pottia areas of > 5 % cover (Fig. 4.4 a) indicate that B. argenteum was not prevalent at high % covers. Except for site 11 taken in an area of encrusted Pottia, epiphytic Nostoc was present at low percentages. No B. pseudotriquetrum was present in these quadrats. The histograms for the areas of B. argenteum >5 % (Fig. 4.4 b) show a greater mix of species. From the results B. argenteum appeared to have a broader range of habitats that it could occupy often overlapping the zones to which Pottia was restricted. Epiphytic Nostoc was more common on Bryum than on Potiia. Often the demarcation between communities was quite marked. By comparing histograms 3 and 4, which represent communities immediately adjacent to each other it can be seen that the species composition was completely different. This phenomenon was especially evident close to the main channel, where there were large differences in the amount of water available to the plants.65 Sue 2   Site 6 : 4 Suc Vi   She 2   Key:O1.

Pottia shows significant positive correlation with hummocks which reflects the apparrent restriction of Pottia to relatively drier ground. Correspondingly the negative association between Pottia and the 2 other plant groups is a consequence of the drier areas being unsuitable for algal growth and apparently less suitable for B. argenteum. The association indicated between Nostoc and B. argenteum is to be expected and correlates with two factors already mentioned. These are the epiphytic nature of Nostoc in the flush and the wide range of habitats that B. argenteum appears to be able to cover. IV:11:V Biomass and nutrients on the lower flush The ash free dry weights and percent nutrient composition of each of Pottia, Bryum and Nostoc from the lower flush are illustrated in Figure 4.6. | Pottia has a significantly higher biomass (5 % level, t test) than Nostoc overall but there is no significant difference between the three sites (top, and middle, lower) on the lower flush. The values presented for percent composition of nutrients at each position on the flush are based on one sample only (five, 1 cm cores were bulked to obtain sufficient dry matter) and therefore any perceivable trends are not statistically significant.70 Figure 4.6: Biomass and nutrient content of plants on the lower flush. middle top —sa500 top Bryum argenteum ag top   lower lower Lower Pottia Nostoc71 Following arcsin transformation of the percent values (Snedecor and Cochran 1967), a t-test was carried out to ascertain any significant differences in elemental composition between plant species. While it appears from the graphs that the nitrogen content of Nostoc is higher than that of the two bryophytes this is not significant at the 5 % level. The levels of potassium are greatest in Nostoc and least in Pottia. Phosphorus and calcium are generally higher in the two bryophyte species than in Nostoc. The only significant difference (5 % level) between species is for phosphorus where Pottia has a significantly higher level than Nostoc. IV:II:VI Sporophyte   In relation to the declining number of bryophyte species toward continental Antarctica, there is a similar decline with increasing latitude in the reported occurrence of fruiting mosses. Capsules are rare in continental Antarctica. During this study numerous Pottia heimii sporophytes were found on both the upper and lower flushes. Their occurrence appeared to be related to microtopography and to the degree of shelter. This is reported in Seppelt et al. (1990) (appendix A). IV:1I:VII Vegetation of the Upper flush The area of the upper flush was mapped from the low lying ground at the margin of the Canada pond, in a north west direction, toward the top of the Canada Glacier (Fig. 4.7). There is a wide outflow area at the base of the |72 Figure 4.7:- Vegetation map of the upper flush.
