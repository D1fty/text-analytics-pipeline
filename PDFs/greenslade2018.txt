GREENSLADE one’ (Wise 1967, 1971). The same population was recorded by Bulavintsev (1995) as Friesea sp., and individuals are here found to have only five ocelli with 1 + 1 reduced on each side of the head, thus differing from all other Antarctic species. The specimens therefore unambiguously belong to a new species, which is described below. Abbreviations Mc -— macrochaeta(e); me — mesochaeta(e); mi — microchaeta(e); s chaeta — sensillum, a; ant — antenna(e); th — thorax; abd - abdomen; PAO - postantennal organ. Systematics The species concept here used is that of morphology, as sufficient characters of this type distinguish the new species from other species in the genus. Moreover, the population has been isolated since glaciations of the continent. Greenslade (2018) noted characters that have been considered species specific for this genus, together with some of their variations. They are: number of ocelli, number of clavate tenent hairs, degree of reduction and form of the furca, number of teeth on the retinaculum, number and position of s chaetae on antennal segment IV, and form and number of anal spines (Smolis 2010). Additional characters useful in distinguishing species are: the relative lengths and form of the chaetae on the body, particularly on abdomen V and VI; the number of spines, spine-like or normal chaetae present on abdomen VI; the relative lengths of s chaetae; ordinary and macrochaetae on abdomen V; and the presence of dorsal cuticular granulation, body size, depth of pigmentation of adults and development of clavate tenent hairs and clavate macrochaetae. Two systems of chaetotaxic nomenclature in the genus have been used by different authors; one is the system developed for Neanurinae by Deharveng and Bedos (1991) where species groups are named according to the position on tergites of the putative secondary tubercles. The other is the system developed by Yossi (1956) for poduromorphs which follows the primitive pattern of three rows of seven chaetae on each side of the thoracic and abdominal tergites. Friesea species often have a loss (reduction) in this pattern, as well as a displacement of some chaetae, making it difficult to confidently assign homologies (Grow and Christiansen 1974; Najt and Rubio 1978). Consequently, as the new species exhibits considerable reduction in chaetal numbers as well as asymmetries, the Deharveng and Bedos (1991) system is used here and recorded in a table. This system was also used by Potapov and Banasco (1985), Deharveng and Bedos (1991) and Weiner et al. (2011) for other species in the genus. It allows the species to be most easily compared to others in the genus and homologies to be identified with greater confidence. The ventral chaetotaxy of ant IV is not normally described or figured in descriptions of new Friesea species but is here shown to possess a significant specific character in that a distinct sensorial rasp is present (Figure 1). The only other species with such a Structure appears to be Friesea furculata Deharveng and Bedos, 1991, where a sensorial rasp is figured comprising two to four chaetae. The new species here has a larger and conspicuous sensorial rasp, and is also distinguished by having 5 + 5 JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY () 2199 with 1 + 1 very reduced ocelli, a very reduced furca, one to four or five faintly clavate tenent hairs and six spines or spinose chaetae on abdomen VI. Materials and methods Five slides carrying a number of specimens of a Friesea species were received from M. Potapov, some with two cover slips with several specimens beneath them. Many specimens were in poor condition, being shrivelled and damaged. The mounting media of two of the slides had dried out leaving only a brown residue. The specimens on these slides were remounted in Berlese medium but one of the slides has only two specimens under one cover slip and numerous Prostigmata mites under the other. All specimens were examined under phase contrast; figures were drawn with a camera lucida and enhanced using Photoshop.

VI and S chaetae long, nearly as long as Mc on abd V. Biology Several specimens had tardigrade claws and rotifer trophi (mouthparts) in their alimentary canals. The genus has been known to feed in micro-invertebrates since Cassagnau’s (1958) publication. Ten species of Tardigrada are known from aquatic habitats near Molodyezhnaya Station and at the Tereshkovoi oasis (Opalifski 1972; Tsujimoto et al. 2014). The rotifer fauna has also been described. Discussion The new species is unlike any other Friesea species known in its unique combination of ocelli, reduced furca and number of anal spines, and spinose chaetae and so is also distinct from other species in the southern polar region. Friesea flava Salmon 1949 from Campbell Island has the same number of ocelli and anal spines, but it has a welldeveloped furca. Friesea woyciechowskii from the South Shetlands has five ocelli and a reduced furca, but it only has two anal spines and a single, more distinct clavate tenent hair. It is also larger at over 1 mm, its chaetae are shorter, ant IV only has four S chaetae, and the macrochaetae are not spine-like. A possible sensorial rasp was described by Weiner (1980) for F. woyciechowskii, consisting of 11 blunt chaetae compared to a slightly smaller one in F. eureka. The new species is likely to be closely related to F. woyciekowski but selection pressures on it, because of the shorter growing season in Enderby Land compared to the South Shetlands, would have been towards earlier maturity so the smaller size and increase in spines and clavate tenent chaetae might be expected. A key to continental Antarctic species of Friesea is given in Greenslade (2018). Friesea eureka sp. nov. is a short-range endemic based on current records. It is found quite commonly in ice-free areas in and around the Russian station Molodyezhnaya. Concern has been expressed in the literature regarding the threat to the locally endemic species on the continent imposed by climate warming, as their distributions are likely to expand and they may come in contact with congenerics (Lee et al. 2017). The nearest other Friesea species on the continent is probably F. sp. cf. grisea, at a distance of approximately JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY () 2205 Table 3.

However, Cryptopygus sverdrupi Lawrence, 1978 has been shown to comprise two genetically distinct lineages separated by only 15 km in nunataks in Dronning Maud Land (Stevens and D’Haese 2014), and, as no sequence data is available for F. eureka, it is possible that different lineages exist for this species too. If it shows a similar pattern to C. sverdrupi, there would be an increased risk of hybridisation and mingling of genotypes under a climate warming scenario. A measure of the ‘biodiversity outlook’ of the Antarctic fauna, taking into consideration the effect of future threats and impacts, concluded it would be the same there as for the rest of the world (Chown et al. 2017). This assessment failed to take into consideration the much higher percentage of endemic species, even genera and their isolated distributions, present in the region compared to the rest of the world. Because of this, impacts would have a relatively greater deleterious effect on the Antarctic fauna. Revised international conservation legislation for Antarctica has recently been adopted (Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Act 2010). It allows listing of specially protected invertebrate species and controls on collecting native invertebrates. It is likely that the new species described here would fulfil the criteria for listing because of its restricted distribution. As no Antarctic Collembola are listed as specially protected species so far, F. eureka sp. nov. appears to be an ideal candidate to list and would emphasise the importance of this group of organisms for ecosystem integrity, especially as there are now five described Friesea species known from the Antarctic Continent and Peninsula (Table 3).
