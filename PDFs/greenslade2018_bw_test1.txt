However, one of these, F. grisea Schaffer, comprises a\n\nnumber of cryptic species of different molecular lineages. The\n\nnew species is distinguished by having 4 + 4 ocelli plus 1 + 1\n\nhardly visible, a very reduced furca, up to four or five faintly\n\nclavate tenent hairs, four anal spines and four spinose chaetae in\n\nadult. The restricted distribution of the species emphasises the\n\nimportance of protecting ice-free areas on the continent as they\n\noften contain at least one locally endemic faunal species\n\nwww.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:865B9AE6-0428-4364-99A4-AF38A764D6D9\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe arthropod fauna of the Antarctic region is impoverished and almost entirely\nrestricted to ice-free areas. This means populations are isolated both geographically\nand climatically. However, within the ice-free areas, some species, such as the\nCollembolon Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni, can be highly abundant (Peterson 1971).\n\nThe most species-rich collembolan genus in the region is Friesea von dalla Torre, 1895. It\ncurrently includes 181 described species worldwide (Bellinger et al. 1996-2017) and is most\nfrequently found in cool, moist and harsh habitats. Friesea species in the Antarctic currently\nnumber four (20% of collembolan fauna) (Deharveng 1981; Greenslade 1995). The genus is\ncharacterised by the unique form of the maxilla, the absence of a post-antennal organ,\nabdomen VI carrying spines or spine-like chaetae and the furca being reduced.\n\nFriesea grisea (Schaffer, 1891) has been recorded on the Antarctic continent from\nseveral localities including Enderby Land, and this record was recently noted by D\xe2\x80\x99Haese\net al. (2017). Wise, however, recorded F. grisea from \xe2\x80\x98Molodyozhnaya Station in Queen\nMaud Land [sometimes used as an alternative name for Enderby Land]\xe2\x80\x99 as a \xe2\x80\x98dubious\n\nCONTACT Penelope Greenslade @Q p.greenslade@federation.edu.au\n\xc2\xa9 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group\n\nPublished online 05 Oct 2018'b'2198 (@&) P. GREENSLADE\n\none\xe2\x80\x99 (Wise 1967, 1971). The same population was recorded by Bulavintsev (1995) as\nFriesea sp., and individuals are here found to have only five ocelli with 1 + 1 reduced on\neach side of the head, thus differing from all other Antarctic species. The specimens\ntherefore unambiguously belong to a new species, which is described below.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nMc -\xe2\x80\x94 macrochaeta(e); me \xe2\x80\x94 mesochaeta(e); mi \xe2\x80\x94 microchaeta(e); s chaeta \xe2\x80\x94 sensillum, a;\nant \xe2\x80\x94 antenna(e); th \xe2\x80\x94 thorax; abd - abdomen; PAO - postantennal organ.\n\nSystematics\n\nThe species concept here used is that of morphology, as sufficient characters of this type\ndistinguish the new species from other species in the genus. Moreover, the population\nhas been isolated since glaciations of the continent. Greenslade (2018) noted characters\nthat have been considered species specific for this genus, together with some of their\nvariations. They are: number of ocelli, number of clavate tenent hairs, degree of reduc-\ntion and form of the furca, number of teeth on the retinaculum, number and position of\ns chaetae on antennal segment IV, and form and number of anal spines (Smolis 2010).\nAdditional characters useful in distinguishing species are: the relative lengths and form\nof the chaetae on the body, particularly on abdomen V and VI; the number of spines,\nspine-like or normal chaetae present on abdomen VI; the relative lengths of s chaetae;\nordinary and macrochaetae on abdomen V; and the presence of dorsal cuticular gran-\nulation, body size, depth of pigmentation of adults and development of clavate tenent\nhairs and clavate macrochaetae.\n\nTwo systems of chaetotaxic nomenclature in the genus have been used by\ndifferent authors; one is the system developed for Neanurinae by Deharveng and\nBedos (1991) where species groups are named according to the position on tergites\nof the putative secondary tubercles. The other is the system developed by Yossi\n(1956) for poduromorphs which follows the primitive pattern of three rows of seven\nchaetae on each side of the thoracic and abdominal tergites. Friesea species often\nhave a loss (reduction) in this pattern, as well as a displacement of some chaetae,\nmaking it difficult to confidently assign homologies (Grow and Christiansen 1974;\nNajt and Rubio 1978). Consequently, as the new species exhibits considerable reduc-\ntion in chaetal numbers as well as asymmetries, the Deharveng and Bedos (1991)\nsystem is used here and recorded in a table. This system was also used by Potapov\nand Banasco (1985), Deharveng and Bedos (1991) and Weiner et al. (2011) for other\nspecies in the genus. It allows the species to be most easily compared to others in\nthe genus and homologies to be identified with greater confidence. The ventral\nchaetotaxy of ant IV is not normally described or figured in descriptions of new\nFriesea species but is here shown to possess a significant specific character in that a\ndistinct sensorial rasp is present (Figure 1). The only other species with such a\nstructure appears to be Friesea furculata Deharveng and Bedos, 1991, where a\nsensorial rasp is figured comprising two to four chaetae. The new species here has\na larger and conspicuous sensorial rasp, and is also distinguished by having 5 + 5'b'JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY () 2199\n\nwith 1 + 1 very reduced ocelli, a very reduced furca, one to four or five faintly clavate\ntenent hairs and six spines or spinose chaetae on abdomen VI.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nFive slides carrying a number of specimens of a Friesea species were received from M.\nPotapov, some with two cover slips with several specimens beneath them. Many speci-\nmens were in poor condition, being shrivelled and damaged. The mounting media of\ntwo of the slides had dried out leaving only a brown residue. The specimens on these\nslides were remounted in Berlese medium but one of the slides has only two specimens\nunder one cover slip and numerous Prostigmata mites under the other. All specimens\nwere examined under phase contrast; figures were drawn with a camera lucida and\nenhanced using Photoshop.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nClass COLLEMBOLA Lubbock\nOrder PODUROMORPHA\nFamily NEANURIDAE\nGenus Friesea Dalla Torre, 1895\nFriesea eureka sp. nov.\n(Figures 1-3)\n\nType locality\n\nTereshkovoi Oasis, near Molodyezhnaya Station, Enderby Land, Eastern Antarctica,\n67.66527778S, 45.8338333E, leg V.

VI and S\nchaetae long, nearly as long as Mc on abd V.\n\nBiology\n\nSeveral specimens had tardigrade claws and rotifer trophi (mouthparts) in their alimen-\ntary canals. The genus has been known to feed in micro-invertebrates since Cassagnau\xe2\x80\x99s\n(1958) publication. Ten species of Tardigrada are known from aquatic habitats near\nMolodyezhnaya Station and at the Tereshkovoi oasis (Opalifski 1972; Tsujimoto et al.\n2014). The rotifer fauna has also been described.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe new species is unlike any other Friesea species known in its unique combination of\nocelli, reduced furca and number of anal spines, and spinose chaetae and so is also\ndistinct from other species in the southern polar region. Friesea flava Salmon 1949 from\nCampbell Island has the same number of ocelli and anal spines, but it has a well-\ndeveloped furca. Friesea woyciechowskii from the South Shetlands has five ocelli and a\nreduced furca, but it only has two anal spines and a single, more distinct clavate tenent\nhair. It is also larger at over 1 mm, its chaetae are shorter, ant IV only has four S chaetae,\nand the macrochaetae are not spine-like. A possible sensorial rasp was described by\nWeiner (1980) for F. woyciechowskii, consisting of 11 blunt chaetae compared to a\nslightly smaller one in F. eureka. The new species is likely to be closely related to F.\nwoyciekowski but selection pressures on it, because of the shorter growing season in\nEnderby Land compared to the South Shetlands, would have been towards earlier\nmaturity so the smaller size and increase in spines and clavate tenent chaetae might\nbe expected. A key to continental Antarctic species of Friesea is given in Greenslade\n(2018).\n\nFriesea eureka sp. nov. is a short-range endemic based on current records. It is found\nquite commonly in ice-free areas in and around the Russian station Molodyezhnaya.\nConcern has been expressed in the literature regarding the threat to the locally endemic\nspecies on the continent imposed by climate warming, as their distributions are likely to\nexpand and they may come in contact with congenerics (Lee et al. 2017). The nearest other\nFriesea species on the continent is probably F. sp. cf. grisea, at a distance of approximately'b'JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY (3) 2205\n\nTable 3.

However, Cryptopygus sverdrupi Lawrence,\n1978 has been shown to comprise two genetically distinct lineages separated by only 15\nkm in nunataks in Dronning Maud Land (Stevens and D\xe2\x80\x99Haese 2014), and, as no sequence\ndata is available for F. eureka, it is possible that different lineages exist for this species too. If\nit shows a similar pattern to C. sverdrupi, there would be an increased risk of hybridisation\nand mingling of genotypes under a climate warming scenario. A measure of the \xe2\x80\x98biodi-\nversity outlook\xe2\x80\x99 of the Antarctic fauna, taking into consideration the effect of future threats\nand impacts, concluded it would be the same there as for the rest of the world (Chown\net al. 2017). This assessment failed to take into consideration the much higher percentage\nof endemic species, even genera and their isolated distributions, present in the region\ncompared to the rest of the world. Because of this, impacts would have a relatively greater\ndeleterious effect on the Antarctic fauna.\n\nRevised international conservation legislation for Antarctica has recently been adopted\n(Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Amendment Act 2010). It allows listing of\nspecially protected invertebrate species and controls on collecting native invertebrates. It\nis likely that the new species described here would fulfil the criteria for listing because of its\nrestricted distribution. As no Antarctic Collembola are listed as specially protected species\nso far, F. eureka sp. nov. appears to be an ideal candidate to list and would emphasise the\nimportance of this group of organisms for ecosystem integrity, especially as there are now\nfive described Friesea species known from the Antarctic Continent and Peninsula (Table 3).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThanks are due to M.
