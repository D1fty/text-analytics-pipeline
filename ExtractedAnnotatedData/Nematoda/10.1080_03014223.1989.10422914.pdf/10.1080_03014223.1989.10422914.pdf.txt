Abstract Asurveywasundertakenofthenematode fauna associated with moss and algal growth from terrestrial sites on Ross Island and the Dry Valleys of the McMurdo Sound region, Antarctica. Six species, in decreasing order of abundance, were identified: Plectus /rigophilus, Eudorylaimus antarcticus, Scottnema lindsayae, Plectus antarcticus,Panagrolaimusdavidi, andMonhystera villosa. Maps are given showing the distribution of these species. Cultures of Panagrolaimus davidi, Plectus antarcticus, and Plectus /rigophilus were establishedonnutrientagarplates, feedingonbacteria.

INTRODUCTION Few surveys have been conducted of the nematode fauna ofthe continental Antarctic. Timm (1971) de- tailedreports ofnematodes to thatdateanddescribed six species of nematodes from various sites in the McMurdo Sound region. These included two members of the Arabolaimida (Plectus antarcticus de Man 1904 and Plectus jrigophilus Kirjanova 1958), two members of the Rhabditida (Scottnema lindsayae Timm 1971 and Panagrolaimus davidi Timm 1971), one member of the Dorylaimida

(Eudorylaimus antarcticus Steiner 1916), and one member of the Monhysterida (Monhystera villosa Biltschli 1873). In addition,Plectusparientinusand tbreeMesodorylaimusspp. havebeenrecorded from Alexander Island in the continental west Antarctic (Maslen 1979) and Yeates (1979) reported Plectus antarcticus, Plectus /rigophilus, and a Helicotylenchus sp. from the Bunger Hills and Gaussberg on the Wilhelm II coast The present survey was conducted during the austral summer of 1988/9 and was based at Scott Base, Ross Island.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Moss andalgal samples were collected from various sites aroundRoss Island and the Dry Valleys area of Antarctica. The samples were weighed (10-80 g) andnematodes andothermicrofaunawereextracted by placing in a 175 cm2 Baermann funnel for 12 h. This extraction period was chosen because of the limited time available for processing samples in Antarctica and because preliminary experiments had indicatedthat most nematodeshadbeenrecover- ed from the sampleduring this interval. The sample was further concentrated by centrifugation and the number of nematodes counted to determine the number ofworms pergramofsample. Other micro- fauna (rotifers, tardigrades, and protozoa) in the sample were noted. The nematodes were identified using the key given by Maslen (1979) and the descriptions in Timm (1971). Culture of nematodes was attempted using nutrient agar (1% agar, 0.1% nutrient broth), cornmeal agar (0.1%) and "bio" agar (1%agar plus one drop of "Baby Bio" plant food). Growth of microorganisms contained in the samples provided food for the nematodes.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results of the survey are shown in Table 1. Sample no. 1was from a small area of moss growth on the lower slopes ofCraterHill behindScottBase.

months and contained no fauna. Six species ofnematodewere found, all ofwhich had been previously recorded by Timm (1971). Where nematodes were abundant they were usually found in association with tardigrades, rotifers, and ciliateprotozoa. Nematodenumbers variedconsider- ably, even indifferent samples from the samegeneral area. In general, algal samples contained greater densities of nematodes than did moss samples. The results of this survey, together with those of Timm (1971), enablemaps to be drawn showing the distribution of the different species of nematode in the McMurdo Sound region (Fig. I, 2). Plectus jrigophilusis the most widespreadspecies (13 sites), followed byE. antarcticus (12 sites), S.lindsayae (9 sites), Plectus antarcticus (6 sites), Panagrolaimus davidi(4sites),andM. villosa (2sites). Most species have a widespread distribution in this area, with the exceptionofM. villosa, whichhasonlybeenrecorded from two sites in the Dry Valleys region, and Panagrolaimusdavidi, whichhasonlybeenrecorded fromcoastalsites.PlectusantarcticusandM. villosa

470 havealsobeenrecordedfrom themaritimeAntarctic (Maslen 1979). The restricted distribution of M.

villosa in the McMurdo Sound region suggests that it is at its southern limit at these sites. E. antarcticus has also been recorded from the west Antarctic (Maslen 1979). The remaining species appear to be restricted to the continental east Antarctic. Cultures of Panagrolaimus davidi, Plectus antarcticus, andPlectusjrigophiluswereestablished on nutrient agar plates, feeding on bacteria which grew from the samples.
