Abstract: Allozymeelectrophoresiswasused to assessgeneticvariabilityanddifferentiationin22populations of Gressittacanthaterranova Wise (Hexapoda, Collembola) from a coastal area of VictoriaLandbetween the Mariner Glacierand theNansen Ice Sheet. Allelicfrequencieswere determinedat fiveenzyme loci: Phi, Pgm, Hk,Mpi andudh . Levelsof variability,estimatedas ratesof heterozygosity,were higher than thosecalculated for the same loci in taxonomicallyrelated and non-related speciesofnon-Antarctic Collembola. Thus, in spite of the ecological simplicityof Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, G. terranova is characterizedby high levelsof genetic variability, and the 22 populations could be divided into three geographic groups, separatedby the Aviator andCampbellglaciers. Genetichfferentiation reflectsthegeographc arrangement of thepopulations, suggestingthat the glaciersare effectivebarriers to gene flow, and that the patchy distributionof collembolan species in Antarctica has the potential to induce, in the long term, microspeciationprocesses. Interestingly, detectable genetic differentiationwas observed between six populations collected at Edmonson Point, even though these are very close to each other, indicating the impact of geographic isolation even within short distances. The only exception to the congruencebetweengeneticand geographicstructuringwas providedby the population of Apostrophe Island, for which a recent introductionwith individuals coming from southern populations is suggested.

Introduction Gressittacantha terranova Wise, 1967 (Hexapoda, Collembola, Isotomidae)is endemicto VictoriaLand, and is one of only eleven species of Collembola reported from Eastern (=Continental)Antarctica (Greenslade 1995). This species is the only known representative of the genus Gressittacantha(Wise 1967,Dallai et al. 1986). The rangeof the species includes the Northern Foothills of Victoria Land (Wise 1967), with limits of hstribution at Football Saddle

(72'30'S, 169'42'E) in the north, and Tripp Island (76'38'S, 162'42'E) in the south (Frati e t a l .  1997, Frati 1999). Gressittacantha terranova is very rare at its geographical limits, where Isotorna klovstadi Carpenter, 1908 and Gomphiocephalus hodgsonz Carpenter, 1908, respectively, are dominant. Gressittacantha terranova is the dominant speciesbetween theMariner Glacier(73'20's) and theNansen Ice Sheet (74"55'S) (Fig. 1)where it usually outnumbers the sympatricspeciesFrzeseagrisea (Schwer, 1891)(Frati et al. 1997). ThedevelopmentofcollembolancommunitiesinAntarctica, as with all Antarctic soil arthropods (Kennedy 1993, Block 1994),is largelydependentupon theavailabilityoffreewater, the presence of some vegetation, a direct or indirect food source (Kennedy 1999), and stones which provide shelter from dehydrating winds (Frati et al. 1997). When these conditions are met, G. terranova occurs in large numbers under stones. Suchconditionsare not uniformlydistributed, and may vary drastically even within short distances, thus ensuring collembolanpopulations are patchy. Furthermore, larger geographic obstacles, for example glaciers, are geographic barriers which effectively confine populations, and limit gene flow even between adjacent populations, promotingdifferentiationandevenmicrospeciationprocesses (Nei et al. 1983). Several genetic markers can be used to assess the levels of genetic variability and differentiation within and between natural populations (Frati et al. 2000, Gaffney2000, Medlin et al. 2000, Skotnicki et al. 2000). Allozymeloci areperhaps the most efficient andwidely exploitedmarker used to study the differentiation between closely related species or conspecificpopulations,andassesslevelsof geneticvariability. Allozymeshavealsobeenextensivelyused tostudypopulation genetics, species boundaries and gene flow in collembolan species from Italy and Europe (Frati et al. 1992, Carapelli et al. 1995,1997,Fanciulliet al. 2000), studieswhichprovide a large amount of comparative data for Antarctic taxa. To test whether the challenging Antarctic environment induceshigh levelsof inter-populationgeneticdifferentiation,

we report on the allele frequencies observed at five enzyme loci in individuals from populations of Gressittacantha terranova collected in the Victoria Land in 1995-96 and 1998-99. Thisrepresentsthefirst studyonpopulationgenetics of Antarctic soil microarthropods, previous studies having focused on marine organisms (Fevolden & Schneppenheim 1989,Brierley&Thorpe 1994,Yokawa 1994,Duhamelet al. 1995, Bargelloni et al. 2000, Medlin et al. 2000), mosses (Skotnicki et al. 2000), and nematodes (Courtright et al. 2000).

Materials and methods Specimens of G. terranova were collected from 22 geographically isolated populations (Table I) between the Mariner Glacier and the Nansen Ice Sheet (Fig. l), reached viahelicoptersbasedat TerraNovaBayResearchStation. Six of thesepopulationswerecollectedat EdmonsonPoint during the 1995-96 BIOTEX-1campof the BIOTASproject (Smith & Wynn-Williams 1992). Even the six populations from Edmonson Point may be consideredgeographically isolated from each other. as they were separated by barren or ice- coveredground. Individual springtails were collectedwith a mechanicalaspiratorand/orextractedfromsoil samplesusing Tullgren hnnels, sorted in the laboratory, killed in liquid nitrogenand storedat -80Â°C until used for electrophoresis. Cellulose-acetateelectrophoresis (Richardson et al. 1986) was done in a Tris-Glycine buffer (0.025M Tris, 0.192M

Each specimenprovided enough material to load two gel-plates, each one stained for a different enzyme. After a 30-40 min run at 200 V, gels were stained with different staining mixtures according to the target enzymes (Murphy et al. 1996). A total of five loci, encoding for five different enzymes, gave interpretable banding patterns: Hexokinase(Hk:EC: 2.7.1. l),Mannosephosphateisomerase (Mpi: EC: 5.3.I&, Phosphohexoso isomerase (Phi; EC: 5.3.1.91,Phosphoglucomutase(Pgm:EC: 5.4.2.2)andMalate dehydrogenase (Mdh; EC: 1.1.1.7). All these enzymes participate in fundamental metabolic pathways, and the possibilityof contamination from the food isnegligibledueto themuchhigher amountofenzymewhich isprovidedfromthe animal's cells. Additional loci were tested (Ark,G3pdh, Got, Hbdh and Zdh) but they did not provide consistent banding patterns, possibly as a consequence of small specimen size (1.0-1.4 mm). Gelswere scored immedately after stainingand letters (A, B, C, D, ....) were assigned to each allele with increasing distance from the origin. Observed genotype frequencies wereentered in the softwareBIOSYS-1(Swofford&Selander 1981)which was used to calculate allele frequenciesat each population. The same program allowed the assessment of within-population variability by estimating observed and expected (under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) heterozygosity, mean number of alleles per locus and percentage of polymorphic loci.

Dendrograms were constructed to show evolutionary relationships according to the UPGMA (Sneath & Sokal 1973) and the Wagner (Farris 1972) methods. Correlation tests between genetic and geographic distances used the

Spearman coefficients in STATISTICA for Windows (ver. 5.1: Statsoft, USA, 1997). Levels of gene flow (Nm) were estimatedfromFSTvaluesusing the equation:FsT=1/(4Nm+l) (Wright 1931).

the expected level of heterozygosityexceeds 40% (with the populationof Cape Sastrugi having > SO%), and only in one population (Campbell Glacier) it is <20%. No unique alleles were identified in the populations of G. terranova (Table I I ) ,  though some allele combinations were peculiar to population groups. Furthermore, certain allelesexhibitedremarkablydifferentfrequenciesindifferent populations. For example, Mpi-G and Hk-G have high frequenciesin the northernpopulations(EmergingIslandand Cape King), Mpi-F is more frequent in the southern group populations, while Mpi-A, Mpi-B, Mpi-C, and Pgm-G were found unique to the 12 central group populations and Apostrophe Island. These data corroborate genetic differentiation congruently with the geographic position of populations. Furthermore, the ApostropheIslandpopulation is more similar to the populationsof the central groupthan to thegeographicallycloserpopulationsof Emerging Islandand Cape King, an observation confirmed by genetic distance values calculated between all possible population pairs (Table 111). In fact, the Apostrophe Island population has a lower average genetic distance (D = 0.073) from the central grouppopulationscomparedwith Emerging Islandand Cape King (0.934 and 0.907, respectively). This places the Apostrophe Island population in the central group, and, furthermore, genetically closer to the southern group populations (average D = 0.426) than to the northern populations. The average genetic distance between all populations is relatively low(D=0.352), but distancesexceedingD=0.900 occur in comparisons involving Emerging Island and Cape King.

With the sole exception of Apostrophe Island, genetic distances tend to correlate with geographic distances. The correlation is positive and highly significant (r = 0.5045; P = 0,0000) when all populations are considered, while removal of Apostrophe Island increases the correlation

(Y = 0.6679; P = O.OOOO), as it does considering only the centralgrouppopulations(r=0.6667;P=0.0000). A slightly lower (r = 0.4394), although still significant (P= 0.0463), correlationisobservedamongthe southerngrouppopulations. The populations of Edmonson Point identified as beach, microclimate station and "Lake Top hill" constitute a very uniformgroup,with lowgeneticdistances(D<0.005). These threecollectingsitesareveryclosetoeachother (<500m), but are still separatedby areas of barren or ice-covered ground. The other three collecting sites have genetic distances comparableto thoseobservedbetweendifferent populations, as could be expected from the larger geographic distance separatingthemfiomtheothercollectingsiteswithinEdmonson Point. The analysisof the 22 populationsvia Wright's F-statistics confirmsthe three group hypothesis. Overall FsTis 0.310, a valuewhich decreases if the Emerging Island and Cape King populationsare excluded (F,, =0.257). Even lowervalues of F,, are found within the groups of central (FsT= 0.122) and southern (FsT= 0.155) populations. Estimates of gene flow (Nm), which can be obtained from F,, values, are relatively low (<1)if populationsfromdifferentgroups areconsidered, compared with estimates within populations from the same group (> 1).

Both reconstructionsshow the populations arranged according to the three aforementioned geographic groups, though ApostropheIsland is included within the central populations group. The only dfference between the two reconstructions is the location of the Cape Sastrug population, which is associatedwith the southern group by UPGMA (Fig. 2) and with the northern populations in the Wagner tree (Fig. 3).

Discussion This work represents the first study on geneticvariabilityof any Antarctic soil arthropod. The small sizeof G. terranova prevented screening of more than five loci; these fiveappear to be among the most variable ones, possibly more variable than most of the loci which have not beenused. Nevertheless, the electrophoretic data collected in this analysis can be directly compared with that obtained from temperate Collembola, enabling comparison of the rate of genetic variability in very different environmental conditions. The number of allelesper locuswas higher compared to the same five loci in other European Collembola(Fig. 4), a difference which cannot be attributed to population number. Indeed, selecting a subset of populations (for example the seven populations of the southern group), the number of alleles scored remains high, or comparablewith the high European scores(Fig. 4). A similar result is obtainedby comparingthe maximum number of different genotypes observed at each locus in a singlepopulationof G. terranovawith that of other Collembola. The Hk locus, for example, yielded 12different genotypesin the populationof Cape Sastrugi, comparedwith a maximumof five in all other collembolanspecies indicated

The number of populations screened for each species is indicated within parentheses Data for G. terranova refers to all 22 populations(first column) and to the seven populationsof the southern group only (second column). Data for other species are from:Carapelli et al. (1997) (Zsofvmurusmaculatus (Schaffer, 1896)); Frati et al. (1994) (Orchesella villosa (Geoffroy, 1762)); Fanciulli et a].

in Fig. 4. The average heterozygosity for G. terranova is 36.4%, a much higher value than that observed for the same fivelociinothercollembolanspecies(Fig. 5 ) .  Thiscomparison suggests G. terranova has a high level of geneticvariability. Such high genetic variability, especiallywithin populations, was not expectedfor a speciesliving in a stableenvironment, where, indeed, a tendency towards genetic uniformity was expected (Nevo 1978, Nevo et al. 1994). These results suggest that, even if stable, the Antarctic environment may positively select high levels of polymorphism, as a survival strategyunder extremecondition(sensuHoffmann&Parsons 1997). While the Antarctic environment is ecologically simple and stable, it is very heterogeneous, and relatively unpredictable,ona smallspatialand temporal scale,providing apossibleexplanationfor theobservedhigh levelsofvariability.

An alternativeexplanation is the time since speciationor the last major bottleneck. The genus Gressittacantha is endemic to Antarctica, and

G. terranova maybe quiteanoldAntarctic species, similar to what has been suggestedfor some Antarctic mites (Marshall & Pugh 1996, Marshall & Coetzee 2000, Pugh & Convey 2000), supporting the hypothesis that the species has not recently undergone remarkable population fluctuations (nor bottlenecks). Genetic variability may also depend upon populationsizeWmura&Ohta 1971).Noempiricalestimates of populations size are currently available for G. terranova, though direct observations (up to 200-300 specimens concentratedunder a single stone)anddatacollectedforother collembolanspecies(Kennedy1999),suggestthat populations are quite large (several thousands of specimens), possibly contributingtopreventinggeneticdrift from leading to allelic fixation and/or loss. One final possibility is that higher variability is due to increasedmutationrates, associatedwithhighAntarcticlevels of UV-B radiation (Kennedy 1995, Skotnicki et al. 2000). Comparinggeneticvariabilitywithother Antarcticorganisms suggests high levels of genetic Variability (estimated via W D )  in Victoria Land moss populations, for example Bryunz pseudotriquetum (Hedw.) Gaertn., Meyer et Scherb. andHennediellaheimii (Hedw.)Zand. (Skotnickiet al. 1998a, Dale et al. 1999). This situation isalsopartiallyconfirmedby datafromthenematodeScothemalindsayaeT i m  (Courtright et al. 2000), where multiple rDNA genotypeswere found in the same population.

geographic distances. The Edmonson Point populations, excepting the three closely related collecting sites of beach, microclimate station and âLake Top hillâ, show levels of genetic distance coinparable with those observed between geographically isolatedpopulations. Edmonson Point north is separatedfrom the beach only by a narrow glacier tongue

(< 100mwide), and the site of EdmonsonPoint north valley is actually the northern part of the beach. The beach itself is not uniformly covered with mosses, and collembolan communitiesonlyoccur in small areas where free snow-melt water allows patches of mosses to grow. Thus, even a well delimited site such as Edinonson Point may contain G. terranovapopulations which are effectively isolated one from another by areas of barren or ice-covered ground, a suggestionconfirmedby theEdmonsonPoint northpopulation clusteringwith theTinkerGlacierpopulation,rather thanwith other Edmonson Point populations. We suggest that even small geographicbarriers (narrow glaciers, areas of barren soil, etc.) can be effective mechanisms for genetic isolation. This conclusion is corroborated by data obtained from the mitochondria1 COII gene in Zsotoma klovstadi (Frati et al. 2000, in press), where geographically isolated populations share only a few or no common haplotype. The observed levels of gene flow also support this hypothesis, in that gene flow seems to be active only among populations of the same geographicgroup. Yet, whenNm< 1,asbetweenpopulations from different geographic groups, gene flow is unable to counteractthe effectof geneticdrift (Wright 193l), leading to populatioiigeneticdifferentiation. Thus, thegeneticstructure of G. terranova appears to be strictly dependent on the geographicdistancebetween its populationsand on the local geographic barriers. Some restrictions to gene flow were detectedalsoforthenematodeScottnemalindsayae(Courtright et al. 20001, and significant genetic divergence between geographically isolated populations was observed in populations of the mosses Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid. (Skotnicki et al. 1998b)and Hennedrellahermii (Dale et al. 1999)separatedby 300 to 500 kin. Antarctic mosses, however, may be dispersedby wind, which appears to be an effectivehomogenizing force (Skotnicki et al. 1998a, 2000, Dale et al. 1999). The general correlation between geographic and genetic distances in populations of G. terranova suggests that geographicfactorsaremost importantinexplainingpopulation differentiation. In this context, a special role is playedby the two major glacierscrossing the area studied: the Aviator and the Campbell. Our genetic data suggest that these glaciers constitute efficient barriers to the exchange of individuals betweenpopulations. Theefficiencyof geographicbarriers is obviously related to the reduced vagility of these animals. Although Collembola are able to walk short distances even acrosssnow(Lyford 1975,Hagvar 1995),therearenodata for large distances. The Antarctic environment is made more complexby its spatial heterogeneity,where suitablehabitats are separated by extremely hostile barriers, and even light winds can blow individuals to unsuitable areas. The pattern observed in G. terranova could represent an intermediate step in the speciationprocess, in which genetic differentiation is arising between isolated populations. Microspeciation processes, in fact, are mediated by the insorgence of genetic differentiation between isolated populations, as a consequenceof differential selectiveforces or, more often, as an effect of random genetic drift between isolatedpopulations (Nei et al. 1983). If thrs is the case, the large glaciers, which appear to constitute efficient gene flow barriers, may eventually allow speciation events. In this context, it is also interesting toobservethat thedistributionof the main species of Collembola in Victoria Land is largely dependent upon glaciers (Wise 1967, Frati et al. 1997, Frati 1999). Zsotomaklovstadi is the dominant speciesnorthofthe Mariner Glacier, Gresszttacantha terranova is dominant between theMariner Glacierand theNansen Ice Sheet,where it is sympatric with the less abundant Friesea grisea, while Gomphiocephalushodgsoni is dominant south to the David Glacier. Interestingly, post-Gondwanan speciation, as a consequenceof geographic isolation, has been suggestedfor the Antarctic mite genus Maudheimia (Marshall & Coetzee 2000). The only significant exception to the correlationbetween geographicandgeneticstructuringofG. terranovapopulations is provided by the population of Apostrophe Island, which clearlybelongs âgeneticallyâ to the central group. The most llkelyhypothesisto explain this pattern is that thepopulation of Apostrophe Island represents a recent introduction of individualsfromtheareabetweentheAviatorand theCampbell glaciers. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the levels of geneticvariability in tlus population are among the lowest of all populations studied (Table II), an observation consistent with the expected reduction of genetic variability due to the âfounder effectâ phenomenon (Mayr 1963). A slightlydifferent scenario could be considered, implying the occurrence of waves of recolonization (the ârescue effectâ sensu Brown & Kodrik-Brown 1977), which have been proposedas a model for insular biogeography,and havebeen suggested to explain the distribution of terrestrial arthropods in the South Sandwich Islands (Convey et al. 2000, Pugh & Convey2000). This latter scenario, however, is onlypossible if passive transport of Collembola is a relatively frequent event. Passive transport over largedistancesmaybe mediated by winds andtor other animals, including man (Gressitt et af.

1960, Wise 1967), and, in other circumstances, passive transport has been claimed to explain the recent introduction of collembolan species such as Protaphorura sp., Folsomia candida (Willem), and Cryptopygus caecus (Wahlgren) in Eastern Antarctica (Greenslade&Wise 1984). Collembola have been caught in aerial traps in Antarctica (Gressitt et al. 1960).In fact,Antarcticwindsareverydry, and soilarthropods areextremelysensitiveto lowhumidityrates, suggestingwind tobeaveryunlikelyfactorfordispersalofAntarcticarthropods (Marshall & Coetzee 2000, Pugh & Convey 2000).

253 contrary,this appearstobean important factorfor dispersalof mosses (Skotnicki el al. 1998a, 2000, Dale et al. 1999) or other invertebrateswhich possess resistant stages enhancing their dispersal capability. While Ocean currents have been proposed for dispersal of Antarctic mites (Pugh & Convey

2000), another possible hypothesis implies the participation ofbirds. Apostrophe Island hostsa large communityof skuas (Cuthaructamaccormicki Saunders)whicharealsoabundant in many collectingsites of the central group, and wluch may be indicated as possible candidates for the transport of individualCollembola. These individualscouldbe entrapped insmallpiecesofsoil or stonesattached to theirfeet. The same phenomena of local immigration and transport may also be claimedto explain the enigmaticpositionof thepopulationof Cape Sastrugi, which is placedwith the northern populations in the Wagner tree (Fig. 3). This work has suggested the influence of the Antarctic environmenton the genetic differentiationof geographically isolatedpopulationsofG. terranova. Thisdataare concordant with those obtained for another collembolan species from Victoria Land, Isotoma klovstadi, where noticeable genetic differentiationbetween isolatedpopulationswas foundusing mitochondrial DNA sequences (Frati et al. 2000, in press). Future work will be needed to confirm the influence of the Antarcticenvironmenton thestructuringofother collembolan species (for example Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni, Friesea grisea), and to test the consistency of such results using different genetic markers, including allozymes and DNA sequences. In this context, it will also be of great help to performsimilarstudiesonspeciesfromtheAntarcticPeninsula, with particular reference to Frieseagrisea, which is the only know collembolan species to occur in both Eastern and Western Antarctica (Greenslade 1995).
