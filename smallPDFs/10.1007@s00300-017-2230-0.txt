Collembola were recently used in another study developed in this site to assess the environmental conditions of two paths used by visitors, showing the importance of this soil faunal community. This motivated the realization of the first comprehensive census of Collembola from Barrientos Island. Fifty-six samples were recorded over three seasons, 2011-2013, from eight different substrate types. During the last campaign, 39 soil samples were also taken to analyze different physical, chemical, biological, microbiological, and biochemical variables in order to put into relation all these environmental conditions with abundance and richness of Collembola species. A total of ten species were recorded, all of them previously cited from Antarctica. The native species Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus Willem (Collembola: Isotomidae) is the most abundant in the island. Two cosmopolitan species—Hypogastrura viatica (Tullberg) (Hypogastruridae) and Mesaphorura macrochaeta Rusek (Tullbergiidae)—were also identified. Many of the species on this island can be considered as eurytopic, appearing in most of the analyzed substrate types. Collembola distribution was found to be influenced by elevation and, to a lesser extent, by phosphorous content and slope. Other variables that are usually cited in the specialized literature did not significantly influence the Collembola distribution in this island. Our results show that the distribution and abundance of Collembola in Antarctic locations is not directly dependent on a single factor. The environmental characteristics of each studied site will determine what factors are driving the composition and structure of this soil community. Keywords Aitcho Islands - Non-indigenous species - Hypogastruridae - Basic collembolan species set - Inter-annual resampling Introduction Barrientos Island (62°24’S, 59°47'W) is located between Robert and Greenwich Islands, in the South Shetland archi Electronic supplementary material The online version of this pelago, Antarctica (Fig. 1). The island is an ice-free area in supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. b 6), hereafter represented in parenthesis by number of habitats with species presence/total of habitats analyze. These species are Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus (8/8), Folsomotoma octooculata (8/8), Cryptopygus badasa (7/8), and Friesea grisea (6/8) (Table 1). Tullbergia mixta (5/8) and Hypogastrura viatica (5/8) form a second group occupied five substrates types. Species with a narrow range of substrates (< 2) would be considered less common at the island. This group is formed by Archisotoma brucei, Friesea bispinosa, Friesea woyciechowskii, and Mesaphorura macrochaeta. Hypogastrura viatica was the only species of the family Hypogastruridae, always presenting low densities barely reaching 300 individuals/m7. This species is not included in the study focused on the environmental requirements of the collembolan species since it was not recorded in 2013, the campaign in which soil samples were taken for this purpose. The same happens with F. woyciechowskii and M. macrochaeta, which are discussed later. Belonging to the family Neanuridae, three species were recorded in Barrientos: Friesea bispinosa, F. grisea, and F. woyciechowskii. The first one was present only in a footpath with very low mean density (seven individuals/m”), not being correlated with any environmental studied variable. Friesea grisea can be considered as eurytopic since it was recorded in a high number of different substrates. However, it had low mean densities, except for wallows where above 1000 individuals/m” were recorded (Table 1). A negative correlation is observed between microbial biomass C and Fgrisea abundance (Spearman rank correlation, rs = — 0.411, n = 39, p = 0.009), hence it was not abundant in those areas that were more favorable for microorganisms. The abundance of this species correlated positively with slope (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.382, n = 39, p = 0.017). Finally, F. woyciechowskii only was found in bryophyte carpets and mats with low mean density (164 individuals/m7). The family Tullbergiidae was represented by Mesaphorura macrochaeta, present only in a wallow with low mean density (36 individuals/m7), and Tullbergia mixta, which appeared in five substrates but with limited mean density (< 873 individuals/m7). The abundance of the later species was positively correlated with the amount of carbonates (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.414, n = 34, p = 0.015). The other four recorded species belong to the family Isotomidae. Archisotoma brucei only was found in two samples, one from a footpath and other from a wallow (Table 1). g) Springer Polar Biology Its abundance was not correlated with any environmental studied variable. Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus was found in all eight types of sampled substrates, indicating eurytopicity. This species presents the highest densities in the island, with means above 48,000 individuals/m7 (Table 1) in areas occupied by the algae Prasiola crispa and penguin colonies. The least favorable substrates for C. a. antarcticus on Barrientos Island were wallows and areas covered by short moss turf and cushions, with very low densities, under 120 individuals/m7. Electrical conductivity had a negative correlation with the abundance of C. a. antarcticus (Spearman rank correlation, rs = — 0.434, n = 34, p = 0.010), as well as microbial biomass C (Spearman rank correlation, rs = — 0.395, n = 39, p = 0.013). Its abundance is positively correlated with slope (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.348, n = 39, p = 0.030). Cryptopygus badasa also appeared in a high variety of substrates, with the exception of footpaths. The abundance of this species correlated positively with slope (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.343, n = 39, p = 0.033). The last species from this family is Folsomotoma octooculata. It was also present in all substrates, with high abundances in wallows and in areas with bryophyte carpets and mats, although without reaching the densities of C. a. antarcticus. Elevation was positively correlated with the abundance of F: octooculata (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.350, n = 39, p = 0.029), as well as slope (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.467, n = 39, p = 0.003). However, pH correlates negatively with the abundance of this species (Spearman rank correlation, rs = — 0.414, n = 39, p = 0.009). Variation of Collembolan species richness and abundance with substrate type and environmental variables Median species richness for Collembola was higher in areas occupied by alga sheets, bryophyte carpets and mats, and short moss turf and cushions (Fig. 2). By contrast, median species richness was usually low in samples taken from penguin colonies, wallow used by southern elephant seals and footpaths. In fact, there are significant differences between species richness and substrate type (Kruskal—Wallis test, H56 = 16.540, p = 0.021). The total number of recorded species in each substrate ranged between four and seven, with penguin colonies and intertidal zone/beaches being the least favorable substrate types for collembolan richness (Table 1). Within the recorded environmental variables, only elevation (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.403, n = 39, p = 0.011) and slope (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.645, n = 39, p = 0.000) were positively correlated with the collembolan species richness. However, the microbial biomass C appeared to adversely affect the collembolan speciesPolar Biology   6 5 “ “ c < 4 oO = “ @ ° oO 2 Ww 2 1 0 ov Oo © 6 cS a 5 s 5 cS Cc Qe 4 i oo B+ Ss aD 3 oo o© SS 2 °o 2 £ a 1 © © 0 “) “” ” ~~ => ” ior » 3 5 8 g E 5 = Oo s 2 = o = v a.

Median (bold line), interquartile range (box), highest and low richness (Spearman rank correlation, rs = — 0.399, n = 39, p = 0.012). Regarding the total abundance of collembolan, higher densities were found in areas occupied by P. crispa, bryophyte carpets and mats and, to a lesser extent, tall moss est values which are no greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range (whiskers), outliers (circles), and extreme values (stars) are shown cushions (hummocks), and short moss turf and cushions (Fig. 2). At these locations, the presence of large amounts of C. a. antarcticus in certain samples was responsible for these high mean abundances. However, there are not significant differences between collembolan abundance g) Springerand substrate type (Kruskal—Wallis test, H56 = 6.744, p = 0.456). Only two environmental variables were correlated with the collembolan abundance, slope positively (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.543, n = 39, p = 0.000), and microbial biomass C negatively (Spearman rank correlation, rs = — 0.365, n = 39, p = 0.022). In order to strengthen the previous analysis, a Canonical Correspondence Analysis was performed. It shows that basically three environmental variables explain the collembolan distribution in the island: elevation, slope, and phosphorous content (p = 0.014), although only one variable, elevation, was significant at 95% (p = 0.032), meanwhile the phosphorous content was significant at 90% (p = 0.095). The ordination diagram (Online Resource 5) shows that C. badasa is likely to be found in substrates with a medium to high content of phosphorous, such as penguin colonies and some vegetated habitats. Folsomotoma octooculata and F. bispinosa are favored by elevation, since they were recorded mainly in sample sites away from the seashore. The other four species included in this test (C. a. antarcticus, T. mixta, M. macrochaeta, and F. grisea) do not show a clear trend and therefore occupy the center of the ordination diagram. Discussion Barrientos Island’s species census This is the first census of Collembola species on Barrientos Island, with a total of ten species recorded during three field campaigns. All species found in this study coincided with the “basic species set” proposed by Russell et al. (2014) for the maritime Antarctica region, which includes the following: C. a. antarcticus, C. badasa, Friesea grisea, F. woyciechowskii, Folsomotoma octooculata, and Tullbergia mixta. In addition, four other species—Friesea bispinosa, Archisotoma brucei, Hypogastrura viatica, and Mesaphorura macrochaeta—were identified, but these are also habitually present in this region. The most abundant species was Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus (Online Resource 2). The species census has increased in this study with each campaign, showing the importance of sampling at different times and, maybe even more important, in different environments. More species are likely to be identified following a higher sampling effort. Accordingly, recent monitoring activities in maritime Antarctica and the northern Antarctic Peninsula have revealed a higher abundance and distribution of non-indigenous species than was previously known (Greenslade et al. 2012; Russell et al. 2014). g) Springer Polar Biology Recorded non-indigenous species Two cosmopolitan species—Hypogastrura viatica and Mesaphorura macrochaeta—were found during two different field campaigns (Online Resource 2), expanding existing knowledge of non-indigenous species in maritime Antarctica (Hughes et al. 2015), and suggesting that biosecurity practices employed to date may not be completely adequate. The first species, H. viatica, is widely distributed in the maritime Antarctic (Frenot et al. 2005; Greenslade and Convey 2012; Hughes et al. 2015). Its expansion throughout this region is favored because it is osmoconformity at higher external values of salt, being able to hyper-regulate the osmotic and 1onic concentration of the hemolymph acclimated for at least 7 days (Witteveen et al. 1987). Its presence could affect the native Collembola, since this species seems to be able to outcompete C. a. antarcticus on coastal sites on South Georgia (Convey et al. 1999). On Barrientos Island, H. viatica was recorded in five types of substrates (from a total of eight), while M. macrochaeta was only present in one (Table 1). The presence of H. viatica could be a consequence of human activity on the island, since it was recorded in the vicinity of footpaths and on beaches visited by tourists. The presence of M. macrochaeta may be associated with the presence of birds or marine mammals that have acted as dispersion vectors (Panagis 1985; Lebedeva and Krivolutsky 2003; Krivolutsky et al. 2004). However, neither hypothesis can be tested with our data. The absence of cosmopolitan species in the samples collected in 2013 could be explained by sampling issues and highly patchy distribution of collembolans (Hertzberg et al. 1994; Ims et al. 2004). In the case of Antarctic Collembola, it is common to find large differences in species richness and abundance from one sample site to another (Tilbrook 1967b) and, therefore, this result is logical and plausible. Collembola is the dominant non-indigenous taxon that has been introduced into different environments within the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc (Hughes et al. 2015), and it established becoming invasive on sub-Antarctic islands (Frenot et al. 2005). Introductions of non-indigenous fauna could trigger alterations of native terrestrial fauna, owing to isolation, high levels of endemism, and a general lack of inter-species competition (Chown and Convey 2007; Convey 2008). The first non-indigenous invertebrate to be reported in the South Shetland Islands in 1949 was the collembolan H. viatica found on Deception Island (Hack 1949). This species was recorded even before, in 1901, on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island (Carpenter 1909). These findings suggest that the introduction and at least transient establishment of non-indigenous species are likely to have been occurring for as long as humans have been inhabiting suitable Antarctic locations, and possibly since the early nineteenth century when sealers first visited the northern Antarctic PeninsulaPolar Biology and South Shetland Islands (Dibbern 2010). The species M. macrochaeta was reported for the first ttme on Macquarie Island in 2008 (Greenslade 2010). It was probably originally introduced to the Southern Hemisphere and northern sites by human intervention in importations of soil, plants, and mosses (Greenslade 1987, 2006). All locations colonized by non-indigenous springtails within Antarctica are subject to high levels of national operator and tourist activity, as is in the case of Barrientos Island (International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators 2015). Tourist visits are concentrated mainly during a 5-month period, from November to March. Visits ashore are generally of short duration and moderate intensity, in groups of fewer than 100 people. Ships that usually anchor at this location carry 200 or fewer passengers and only one ship can disembark passengers at a time, with a maximum of two ships per day. With the exception of closed areas, visitors can roam freely under supervision (Antarctic Treaty Secretariat 2015). Researchers also visit the island along the austral summer season, although in a much smaller number that varies according to the needs of the research projects developed each year. The risk of bioinvasions between different remote Antarctic locations may be increasing due to the continuous movement of scientists and tourists, facilitating undesirable and unintended translocations. In this context, there is a real possibility of spreading collembolan species around Barrientos Island through the movement of visitors. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested. To reduce the impact of non-indigenous species within the Antarctic Treaty area, the measures proposed by Hughes et al. (2015) need to be applied. These include better education of all Antarctic visitors, biosecurity practices in all Antarctic operations, monitoring of high activity sites for non-indigenous introductions, development of contingency plans, including eradication protocols, and inclusion of information on how to respond to a non-indigenous species introduction within protected area management plans. Influence of environmental conditions on Collembolan species We already commented that Collembola presence depends on different environmental factors, mainly soil moisture, organic matter, and vegetation cover (Tilbrook 1967a; Hop kin 1997; Adams et al. 2006; Sinclair et al. 2006; Day et al. 2009; Russell et al. 2014). However, our findings do not point to the two first variables as key factors for the distribution and abundance of Barrientos’ Collembola. This could be because soil moisture is not usually a problem on this island because there is abundant rainfall in liquid form throughout the austral summer. In addition, the small size of the island facilitates the influence of moisture-laden sea breezes, as a result soils here rarely suffer water stress. Soil organic matter neither is a limiting factor for Collembola at this site owing to its high concentrations in the study sites, especially in vegetated areas (Online Resource 4). The third environmental variable, vegetation cover, cannot be considered as a limitation problem in an island that precisely stands out because of its high coverage of vegetation communities. However, other environmental variables, such as elevation or phosphorous content, are important for Collembola on this site. Regarding elevation, a certain altitude in Barrientos means a greater abundance of vegetation, because of the island there is a greater availability of habitats far from the coast, since the shoreline is vegetation-free except for some algae. This trend is not common on other larger Antarctic islands where glaciers immediately appear as one moves inland, and favorable environments for Collembola disappear rapidly. In the case of phosphorous, a higher concentration of this nutrient can also contributes to a greater food availability for Collembola, mainly algae. On Barrientos Island, environments dominated by the algae Prasiola crispa, which usually is present close to nutrient-rich areas such as penguin colonies, appeared to favor Collembola owing to these sites have a highest species richness and density. Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus has a marked preference for this algae, although it feeds on a wide variety of food, being able to take advantage of different nutrients present in algae, mosses, and lichens, but also filamentous fungi (Broady 1979) and dead organic material (Bokhorst et al. 2007). Behind its predilection for P. crispa is the greater nitrogen concentration present in this algae regarding lichens. Although this nutrient is present in mosses in similar concentrations, they contain inhibitory and refractory compounds which are difficult for soil arthropods to digest. Therefore, mosses are less consumed by C. a. antarcticus when both types of food, algae and mosses, are present in the environment (Davidson and Broady 1996). This explains the high presence of this species in alga sheet (Online Resource 2). This species plays an essential role in the nutrient flow of the environments in the maritime Antarctica which are dominated by algae and mosses (Bokhorst et al. 2007). Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus Was very common in our samples, being alga sheet and bryophyte carpets and mats the substrates with higher average species richness. Data suggest that other non-recorded environmental variables could be important for certain species. For example, Cryptopygus badasa, the other species of the genus Cryptopygus present on the island, appeared in most of the sampled substrate types with the exception of footpaths. This may be because it does not tolerate excess surface temperature (Russell et al. 2014) as is in the case of exposed bare soil in footpaths. Although this variable was not recorded during sampling, the observed abundance pattern supports this possibility. g) SpringerIn addition to the environmental factors, other variables must be taken into account when interpreting the abundance results obtained for each habitat. This is the case of the trophic strategy of the Collembola. The genus Friesea is a perfect example of this question, since species belonging to it are usually predators. On Barrientos Island, the species with the largest representation for this genus was F. grisea. Its maximum presence (3056 specimens/ m7”) was detected in a sample from a wallow. Wallows used by southern elephant seals are terrestrial nutrient enrichment areas through deposits of feces, urine, and molted skin from them (Panagis 1985). Nematodes are strongly related to soil organic matter since many of them are detritivores (Yergeau et al. 2007). Hence, the probability of finding nematodes in wallows is high. In fact, the presence of these invertebrates was observed when wallows’ samples were processed (unpublished data). Therefore, it is not surprising that F. grisea abundance was elevated in this site. This species was present in almost all types of substrates, although with low densities for substrates other than wallows. This indicates that F. grisea was widely distributed on Barrientos Island, although with low densities typical for a predator. Friesea bispinosa and F. woyciechowskii, the other two species of this genus, were less abundant than F. grisea, only 109 and 327 individuals/m’, respectively, were recorded during three field campaigns. Therefore their relative importance in the community of Collembola on this island is much lower. Morphological issues also may be considered to explain the collembolan distribution. Folsomotoma octooculata is an epedaphic species that has a longer furca than other species recorded in this study, allowing it to have greater ability to colonize less accessible areas, including steeper areas, hence elevation and slope favor this species. Therefore, it is not surprising that this species is present in all the habitats analyzed on the island. Even taking into account all the issues raised above, we must emphasize that we have tried to be cautious with the interpretation of the results concerning the distribution of springtails in the different environments of the island. The reason is that a stratified sampling was used, with sampling efforts that varied according to the type of substrate and their representativeness and importance on Barrientos Island. Besides, samples for the environmental study were only recorded in 2013 campaign, resulting in a slated representation of substrate types (6/8) and species (7/10). Therefore, results should be compared with caution since they are not based on a similar sampling effort. Besides, Collembola have a natural tendency for aggregation and patchy distribution (Ims et al. 2004), as well as population fluctuations from year to year (Pollierer and Scheu 2017). All this makes difficult to identify trends in their distribution, discouraging the assumption of strict axioms regarding this issue. g) Springer Polar Biology Finally, our study has also generated unexpected results regarding the limitations on the presence of certain species because of environmental conditions. Archisotoma brucei is usually classified as strictly marine-littoral species, like all species in this genus, although individuals have been recorded in large numbers in traps set supralittorally on Heard Island and in Tasmania presumably blown in sea spray (Greenslade 2010). In Barrientos, it was recorded in 2012 on a footpath about 100 meters away from the shoreline. While this is an unusual location for the species, other studies have also found specimens of A. brucei at some distance from the shore. For example, Gressitt (1967) collected one specimen from rocks on a raised terrace immediately around a chinstrap penguin nest. Tilbrook (1967b) cited some specimens on an ash plane near shore, but not on the beach. More recently, Russell et al. (2014) found specimens on Devil Island in soil substrates. Accordingly, it is possible that this species will be able to colonize areas at some distance from the shoreline if soil texture and other environmental factors are suitable, not being so restricted to the shoreline as was thought (Greenslade and van Klinken 1994). Future studies may be developed to test this hypothesis. Conclusions The present study increases the knowledge on the distribution of Antarctic Collembola, generating the first list of species for Barrientos Island, a location that has not been subject to a systematic census until now despite being a traditional tourist destination in the South Shetland Islands. Although all recorded species had already been cited in Antarctica, two non-indigenous species were found—Hypogastrura viatica and Mesaphorura macrochaeta—expanding the list of Antarctic sites in which exotic collembolans have been located. In spite of these presences, the local Collembola community seems to be relatively healthy in view of the obtained results, with a high richness (ten species) for Antarctic standards. The environmental information obtained was limited and did not allow going deeper in the patterns that govern the distribution of the springtails in the island. Nevertheless, certain environmental variables have increased the list of factors that may be important for these organisms, such as elevation, phosphorous content, or slope. These factors are probably directly related to the number of available habitats for Collembola. This confirms the importance of sampling in different environments, and at different times if possible, in order to obtain a more complete species census when you work in Antarctic sites.
