Mattioli 4, 53100 Siena, Italy *corresponding author - frati@unisi.it Abstract: Allozyme electrophoresis was used to assess genetic variability and differentiation in 22 populations of Gressittacantha terranova Wise (Hexapoda, Collembola) from a coastal area of Victoria Land between the Mariner Glacier and the Nansen Ice Sheet. Allelic frequencies were determined at five enzyme loci: Phi, Pgem, Hk, Mpi and Mah. Levels of variability, estimated as rates of heterozygosity, were higher than those calculated for the same loci in taxonomically related and non-related species of non-Antarctic Collembola. Thus, in spite of the ecological simplicity of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, G. terranova is characterized by high levels of genetic variability, and the 22 populations could be divided into three geographic groups, separated by the Aviator and Campbell glaciers. Genetic differentiation reflects the geographic arrangement of the populations, suggesting that the glaciers are effective barriers to gene flow, and that the patchy distribution of collembolan species in Antarctica has the potential to induce, in the long term, microspeciation processes. Interestingly, detectable genetic differentiation was observed between six populations collected at Edmonson Point, even though these are very close to each other, indicating the impact of geographic isolation even within short distances. The only exception to the congruence between genetic and geographic structuring was provided by the population of Apostrophe Island, for which a recent introduction with individuals coming from southern populations is suggested. Received 23 January 2001, accepted 2 May 2001 Key words: allozyme electrophoresis, gene flow, geographic differentiation, genetic distance, heterozygosity, speciation Introduction Gressittacantha terranova Wise, 1967 (Hexapoda, Collembola, Isotomidae) is endemic to Victoria Land, and is one of only eleven species of Collembola reported from Eastern (=Continental) Antarctica (Greenslade 1995). This species is the only known representative of the genus Gressittacantha (Wise 1967, Dallai et a/. 1986). The range of the species includes the Northern Foothills of Victoria Land (Wise 1967), with limits of distribution at Football Saddle (72°30'S, 169°42'E) in the north, and Tripp Island (76°38'S, 162°42'E) in the south (Frati ef al. 1997, Frati 1999). Gressittacantha terranova is very fare at its geographical limits, where [sotoma klovstadi Carpenter, 1908 and Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni Carpenter, 1908, respectively, are dominant. Gressittacantha terranova is the dominant species between the Mariner Glacier (73°20'S) and the Nansen Ice Sheet (74°55'S) (Fig. 1) where it usually outnumbers the sympatric species Friesea grisea (Schaffer, 1891) (Frati et ai. 1997). The development of collembolan communities in Antarctica, as with all Antarctic soil arthropods (Kennedy 1993, Block 1994), is largely dependent upon the availability of free water, the presence of some vegetation, a direct or indirect food source (Kennedy 1999), and stones which provide shelter 246 from dehydrating winds (Frati et al. 1997). When these conditions are met, G. ferranova occurs in large numbers under stones. Such conditions are not uniformly distributed, and may vary drastically even within short distances, thus ensuring collembolan populations are patchy. Furthermore, larger geographic obstacles, for example glaciers, are geographic barriers which effectively confine populations, and limit gene flow even between adjacent populations, promoting differentiation and even microspeciation processes (Nei et al. 1983). Several genetic markers can be used to assess the levels of genetic variability and differentiation within and between natural populations (Frati ef a/. 2000, Gaffney 2000, Medlin et al, 2000, Skotnicki et a/, 2000). Allozyme loci are perhaps the most efficient and widely exploited marker used to study the differentiation between closely related species or conspecific populations, and assess levels of genetic variability. Allozymes have also been extensively used to study population genetics, species boundaries and gene flow in collembolan species from Italy and Europe (Frati et al. 1992, Carapelli et al. 1995, 1997, Fanciulliet a/. 2000), studies which provide a large amount of comparative data for Antarctic taxa.

See Table I for the number indicating each population. we report on the allele frequencies observed at five enzyme loci in individuals from populations of Gressittacantha terranova collected in the Victoria Land in 1995-96 and 1998-99. This represents the first study on population genetics of Antarctic soil microarthropods, previous studies having focused on marine organisms (Fevolden & Schneppenheim 1989, Brierley & Thorpe 1994, Yokawa 1994, Duhamelez? al. 1995, Bargelloni et a/, 2000, Medlin ef a/. 2000), mosses (Skotnicki et a/, 2000), and nematodes (Courtright ef al. 2000). Materials and methods Specimens of G. terranova were collected from 22 geographically isolated populations (Table [) between the Mariner Glacier and the Nansen Ice Sheet (Fig. 1), reached via helicopters based at Terra Nova Bay Research Station. Six of these populations were collected at Edmonson Point during the 1995--96 BIOTEX-1 camp of the BIOTAS project (Smith & Wynn-Williams 1992). Even the six populations from Edmonson Point may be considered geographically isolated from each other, as they were separated by barren or icecovered ground. Individual springtails were collected with a mechanical aspirator and/or extracted from soil samples using Tullgren funnels, sorted in the laboratory, killed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until used for electrophoresis. Cellulose-acetate electrophoresis (Richardson et al. 1986) was done in a Tris-Glycine buffer (0.025M Tris, 0.192M 247 Table I. List of populations studied in this work.

Single specimens were individually ground 1n 8 ul of distilled water and each lane of the gel was loaded with the homogenate of one individual. Each specimen provided enough material to load two gel-plates, each one stained for a different enzyme. After a 30-40 min run at 200 V, gels were stained with different staining mixtures according to the target enzymes (Murphy et a/. 1996). A total of five loci, encoding for five different enzymes, gave interpretable banding patterns: Hexokinase (Hk; EC: 2.7.1.1), Mannose phosphate isomerase (Mpi. EC: 5.3.1.8), Phosphohexoso isomerase (Phi, EC: 5.3.1.9), Phosphoglucomutase (Pgm, EC: 5.4.2.2) and Malate dehydrogenase (Mdh, EC: 1.1.1.7). All these enzymes participate in fundamental metabolic pathways, and the possibility of contamination from the food is negligible due to the much higher amount of enzyme which is provided from the animal’s cells. Additional loci were tested (Ark, G3pdh, Got, Hbdh and Idh) but they did not provide consistent banding patterns, possibly as a consequence of small specimen size (1.0-1.4 mm). Gels were scored immediately after staining and letters (A, B, C, D, ....) were assigned to each allele with increasing distance from the origin. Observed genotype frequencies were entered in the software BIOS YS-1 (Swofford & Selander 1981) which was used to calculate allele frequencies at each population. The same program allowed the assessment of within-population variability by estimating observed and expected (under the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) heterozygosity, mean number of alleles per locus and percentage of polymorphic loci.

The northern group includes Emerging Island, Apostrophe Island and Cape King (20 to 22 in Fig. 1 and Table I), the central group contains 12 populations (8— 19 in Fig. 1 and Table I, and the southern group includes the remaining seven populations (1-7 in Fig. 1 and Table I). Allele frequencies observed at the five loci studied in the 22 populations (Table II) suggest four loci were highly polymorphic, with eight different alleles scored for Pgm, Mpi and Hk, and seven alleles for Phi. The locus Mdh was the least variable, with only two scored alleles. Some populations were remarkably polymorphic, such as Gondwana station (six alleles in the Pgm locus), Edmonson Point "Lake Top hill", Baker Rocks and Burns Glacier (seven alleles in the Pgm locus), and Kay Island (five alleles in the Phi locus). Higher levels of within-population variability in G. terranova are also apparent from the rates of heterozygosity, averaged in each population for all five loci (Table II).

No unique alleles were identified in the populations of G. terranova (Table ID, though some allele combinations were peculiar to population groups. Furthermore, certain alleles exhibited remarkably different frequencies in different populations. For example, M/pi-G and Hk-G have high frequencies in the northern populations (Emerging Island and Cape King), Mpi-F is more frequent in the southern group populations, while Mpi-A, Mpi-B, Mpi-C, and Pgm-G were found unique to the 12 central group populations and Apostrophe Island. These data corroborate genetic differentiation congruently with the geographic position of populations. Furthermore, the Apostrophe Island population is more similar to the populations of the central group than to the geographically closer populations of Emerging Island and Cape King, an observation confirmed by genetic distance values calculated between all possible population pairs (Table IIT). In fact, the Apostrophe Island population has a lower average genetic distance (D = 0.073) from the central group populations compared with Emerging Island and Cape King (0.934 and 0.907, respectively). This places the Apostrophe Island population in the central group, and, furthermore, genetically closer to the southern group populations (average D = 0.426) than to the northern populations. The average genetic distance between all populations is relatively low (D = 0.352), but distances exceeding D = 0.900 occur in comparisons involving Emerging Island and Cape King.

FANCIULLI et al. central (inchiding Apostrophe Island) and southern, are genetically distinct, with average genetic distances within the same group never exceeding 0.130 (Table I'V), while distances between populations from different groups range from 0.450 (central vs southern) to 0.877 (northern vs central). With the sole exception of Apostrophe Island, genetic distances tend to correlate with geographic distances. The correlation is positive and highly significant (r = 0.5045; P = 0.0000) when all populations are considered, while removal of Apostrophe Island increases the correlation (r = 0.6679; P = 0.0000), as it does considering only the central group populations (r = 0.6667; P= 0.0000). A slightly lower (r = 0.4394), although still significant (P = 0.0463), correlation is observed among the southern group populations. The populations of Edmonson Point identified as beach, microclimate station and "Lake Top hull" constitute a very uniform group, with low genetic distances (D <0.005). These three collecting sites are very close to each other (< 500 m), but are still separated by areas of barren or ice-covered ground. The other three collecting sites have genetic distances comparable to those observed between different populations, as could be expected from the larger geographic distance separating them from the other collecting sites within Edmonson Point. The analysis of the 22 populations via Wright’s F-statistics confirms the three group hypothesis. Overall F... 1s 0.310, a value which decreases if the Emerging Island and Cape King populations are excluded (F,.. = 0.257). Even lower values of F.. are found within the groups of central (F,,. = 0.122) and southern (F,,. = 0.155) populations. Estimates of gene flow (Nm), which can be obtained from F,.. values, are relatively low (< 1) if populations from different groups are considered, compared with estimates within populations from the same group (> 1).

Both reconstructions show the populations arranged according to the three aforementioned geographic groups, though Apostrophe Island is included within the central populations group. The only difference between the two reconstructions is the location of the Cape Sastrugi population, which is associated with the southern group by UPGMA (Fig. 2) and with the northern populations in the Wagner tree (Fig. 3). Discussion This work represents the first study on genetic variability of any Antarctic soil arthropod. The small size of G. terranova prevented screening of more than five loci; these five appear to be among the most variable ones, possibly more variable than most of the loci which have not been used. Nevertheless, the electrophoretic data collected in this analysis can be directly compared with that obtained from temperate Collembola, enabling comparison of the rate of genetic variability in very different environmental conditions. The number of alleles per locus was higher compared to the same five loci in other European Collembola (Fig. 4), a difference which cannot be attributed to population number. Indeed, selecting a subset of populations (for example the seven populations of the southern group), the number of alleles scored remains high, or comparable with the high European scores (Fig. 4). A similar result is obtained by comparing the maximum number of different genotypes observed at each locus in a single population of G. ferranova with that of other Collembola. The 7k locus, for example, yielded 12 different genotypes in the population of Cape Sastrugi, compared with a maximum of five in all other collembolan species indicated Inexpressible Is.

The average heterozygosity for G. terranova is 36.4%, a much higher value than that observed for the same five loci in other collembolan species (Fig. 5). This comparison suggests G. terranova has a high level of genetic variability. Such high genetic variability, especially within populations, was not expected for a species living ina stable environment, where, indeed, a tendency towards genetic uniformity was expected (Nevo 1978, Nevo ef al. 1994). These results suggest that, even if stable, the Antarctic environment may positively select high levels of polymorphism, as a survival strategy under extreme condition (sensu Hoffmann & Parsons 1997). While the Antarctic environment is ecologically simple and stable, it is very heterogeneous, and relatively unpredictable, on a small spatial and temporal scale, providing apossible explanation for the observed high levels of variability. An alternative explanation is the time since speciation or the last major bottleneck.

(2000) (Tomocerus vulgaris, T. minor (Lubbock, 1862), Pogonognathellus flavescens, P. longicornis (Miiller, 1776)). G, terranova may be quite an old Antarctic species, similar to what has been suggested for some Antarctic mites (Marshall & Pugh 1996, Marshall & Coetzee 2000, Pugh & Convey 2000), supporting the hypothesis that the species has not recently undergone remarkable population fluctuations (nor bottlenecks). Genetic variability may also depend upon population size (Kimura & Ohta 1971). Noempirical estimates of populations size are currently available for G. terranova, though direct observations (up to 200-300 specimens concentrated under a single stone) and data collected for other collembolan species (Kennedy 1999), suggest that populations are quite large (several thousands of specimens), possibly contributing to preventing genetic drift from leading to allelic fixation and/or loss. One final possibility is that higher variability is due to increased mutation rates, associated with high Antarctic levels of UV-B radiation (Kennedy 1995, Skotnicki et a/. 2000). Comparing genetic variability with other Antarctic organisms suggests high levels of genetic variability (estimated via RAPD) in Victoria Land moss populations, for example Bryum pseudotriquetum (Hedw.) Gaertn., Meyer et Scherb. and Hennediella heimii (Hedw.) Zand. (Skotnicki ef al. 1998a, Dale et al. 1999). This situation is also partially confirmed by data from the nematode Scottnema lindsayae Timm (Courtright et al. 2000), where multiple rDNA genotypes were found in the same population. The current study suggests a low level of gene flow between populations, since these can be differentiated over very small Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

FANCIULLI et al. geographic distances. The Edmonson Point populations, excepting the three closely related collecting sites of beach, microclimate station and "Lake Top hill", show levels of genetic distance comparable with those observed between geographically isolated populations. Edmonson Point north is separated from the beach only by a narrow glacier tongue (< 100 m wide), and the site of Edmonson Point north valley is actually the northern part of the beach. The beach itself is not uniformly covered with mosses, and collembolan communities only occur in small areas where free snow-melt water allows patches of mosses to grow. Thus, even a well delimited site such as Edmonson Point may contain G. terranova populations which are effectively isolated one from another by areas of barren or ice-covered ground, a suggestion confirmed by the Edmonson Point north population clustering with the Tinker Glacier population, rather than with other Edmonson Point populations. We suggest that even small geographic barriers (narrow glaciers, areas of barren soil, etc.) can be effective mechanisms for genetic isolation. This conclusion is corroborated by data obtained from the mitochondrial COII gene in Jsotoma klovstadi (Frati et al. 2000, in press), where geographically isolated populations share only a few or no common haplotype. The observed levels of gene flow also support this hypothesis, in that gene flow seems to be active only among populations of the same geographic group. Yet, when Nm < 1, as between populations from different geographic groups, gene flow is unable to counteract the effect of genetic dnft (Wright 1931), leading to population genetic differentiation. Thus, the genetic structure of G. terranova appears to be strictly dependent on the geographic distance between its populations and on the local geographic barriers. Some restrictions to gene flow were detected also for the nematode Scottnema lindsayae (Courtright etal. 2000), and significant genetic divergence between geographically isolated populations was observed in populations of the mosses Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid. (Skotnicki ef al. 1998b) and Hennediella heimii (Dale et al. 1999) separated by 300 to 500 km. Antarctic mosses, however, may be dispersed by wind, which appears to be an effective homogenizing force (Skotnicki et al. 1998a, 2000, Dale et al. 1999). The general correlation between geographic and genetic distances in populations of G. ferranova suggests that geographic factors are most important in explaining population differentiation. In this context, a special role is played by the two major glaciers crossing the area studied: the Aviator and the Campbell. Our genetic data suggest that these glaciers constitute efficient barriers to the exchange of individuals between populations. The efficiency of geographic barriers is obviously related to the reduced vagility of these animals. Although Collembola are able to walk short distances even across snow (Lyford 1975, Hagvar 1995), there are no data for large distances. The Antarctic environment is made more complex by its spatial heterogeneity, where suitable habitats are separated by extremely hostile barriers, and even light winds can blow individuals to unsuitable areas. The pattern observed in G. terranova could represent an intermediate step in the speciation process, in which genetic differentiation 1s arising between isolated populations. Microspeciation processes, in fact, are mediated by the insorgence of genetic differentiation between isolated populations, as a consequence of differential selective forces or, more often, as an effect of random genetic drift between isolated populations (Nei ef a/. 1983). If this is the case, the large glaciers, which appear to constitute efficient gene flow barriers, may eventually allow speciation events. In this context, it is also interesting to observe that the distribution of the main species of Collembola in Victoria Land is largely dependent upon glaciers (Wise 1967, Frati et al. 1997, Frati 1999). [sotoma klovstadi is the dominant species north of the Mariner Glacier, Gressittacantha terranova is dominant between the Mariner Glacier and the Nansen Ice Sheet, where it is sympatric with the less abundant Friesea grisea, while Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni is dominant south to the David Glacier. Interestingly, post-Gondwanan speciation, as a consequence of geographic isolation, has been suggested for the Antarctic mite genus Afaudheimia (Marshall & Coetzee 2000). The only significant exception to the correlation between geographic and genetic structuring of G. terranova populations is provided by the population of Apostrophe Island, which clearly belongs “genetically” to the central group. The most likely hypothesis to explain this pattern is that the population of Apostrophe Island represents a recent introduction of individuals from the area between the Aviator and the Campbell glaciers. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the levels of genetic variability in this population are among the lowest of all populations studied (Table II), an observation consistent with the expected reduction of genetic variability due to the “founder effect” phenomenon (Mayr 1963). A slightly different scenario could be considered, implying the occurrence of waves of recolonization (the “rescue effect” sensu Brown & Kodrik-Brown 1977), which have been proposed as a model for insular biogeography, and have been suggested to explain the distribution of terrestrial arthropods in the South Sandwich Islands (Convey eft a/. 2000, Pugh & Convey 2000). This latter scenario, however, is only possible if passive transport of Collembola is a relatively frequent event. Passive transport over large distances may be mediated by winds and/or other animals, including man (Gressitt ef ai. 1960, Wise 1967), and, in other circumstances, passive transport has been claimed to explain the recent introduction of collembolan species such as Protaphorura sp., Folsomia candida (Willem), and Cryptopygus caecus (Wahlgren) in Eastern Antarctica (Greenslade & Wise 1984). Collembola have been caught in aerial traps in Antarctica (Gressitt et al. 1960). Infact, Antarctic winds are very dry, and soil arthropods are extremely sensitive to low humidity rates, suggesting wind to bea very unlikely factor for dispersal of Antarctic arthropods (Marshall & Coetzee 2000, Pugh & Convey 2000).

While ocean currents have been proposed for dispersal of Antarctic mites (Pugh & Convey 2000), another possible hypothesis implies the participation of birds. Apostrophe Island hosts a large community of skuas (Catharacta maccormicki Saunders) which are also abundant in many collecting sites of the central group, and which may be indicated as possible candidates for the transport of individual Collembola. These individuals could be entrapped in small pieces of soil or stones attached to their feet. The same phenomena of local immigration and transport may also be claimed to explain the enigmatic position of the population of Cape Sastrugi, which is placed with the northern populations in the Wagner tree (Fig. 3). This work has suggested the influence of the Antarctic environment on the genetic differentiation of geographically isolated populations of G. terranova. Thisdata are concordant with those obtained for another collembolan species from Victoria Land, [sotoma klovstadi, where noticeable genetic differentiation between isolated populations was found using mitochondrial DNA sequences (Frati et al. 2000, in press). Future work will be needed to confirm the influence of the Antarctic environment on the structuring of other collembolan species (for example Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni, Friesea grisea), and to test the consistency of such results using different genetic markers, including allozymes and DNA sequences. In this context, it will also be of great help to perform simular studies on species from the Antarctic Peninsula, with particular reference to Friesea grisea, which 1s the only know collembolan species to occur in both Eastern and Western Antarctica (Greenslade 1995).
