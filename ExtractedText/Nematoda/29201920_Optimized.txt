Terrestrial Biclopical Studies in Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. A Thesis submutted in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the Degree of Master of Science in Biological Sciences at The University of Waikato by ANNE-MARBREE J. SCHWARZ a Dd ee University of Waikato — 1990 Dedication For Mike and Jan who have always provided stimuius and encouragement for my ideas. 121 Abstract The bicta, comprising the bryophyte flushes an continental Antarctica, are spacialized organisms adapted to the rigorous conditions imposed on them by the environment. ice free areas of continental Antarctica provide the few habitats suitable for colonization by plants and invertebrates. The presence of free water and certain climatic conditions are essential features. This report investigates bryophyte flushes in two ice free areas in Southern Victona Land. The first is within the Lake Fryxell Site of Special Scientific Interest No.12 adjacent to the Canada Glacier in the Taylor Valley, one of the so called Dry Valleys. The second is at Granite Harbour approximately sixty kilometres north of the Taylor Vailey site. The purpose of this investigation was to ascertain plant and invertebrate species present at these sites and to obtaim some measure of their distribution and abundance. Climatic data are presented for the period of the study. Ai the Canada Glacier site, plant associations were mapped in detail and biomass and nutrient values were calculated. Numerous counts of invertebrates were recorded from cores of plant material. Qn the maim flush, sites which had been damaged by sampling in the past were located, These were mapped, and described, envisaging that these will be important reference sites to monitor the ability ef these flushes to recover from physical damage. At Granite Harbour a qualitative investigation of plants iv and invertebrates was carried out. Comprehensive plant species lists have been compiled from the Canada Glacier and Granite Harbour areas. The different prevailing conditions for plant growth at the two sites are emphasised by the differences in numbers of species found. Biomass fgures from the Taylor Valley compare favourably with figures presented for lower latitudes of the Antarctic region. The plant species list from Granite Harbour is exceptional in its extent for a site of this latitude. Invertebrate groups have been recorded for both sites. Counts of individuals from the Taylor Valley provide estimates of abundance which compare in number to estimates from maritime Antarctic locations. It is concluded that the bryophyte flushes at the Lake Fryxell Site of Special Scientific Interest (S.8.8.1) are areas of relatively high biomass, with community patterning closely linked to the water regime ofthe area. They are likely to have a low annual net production and a low capacity for recolonization. This is the largest area of bryophyte growth reported for the Dry Valley region and as such should play an important role im consideration of future impacts and studies in the area. This summary of biota, present at the Canada Glacier bryophyte flushes stands as the only collective record of these parameters to date for this area. The production of these data is the first necessary step to enable further monitoring and conservation to be carried out.

They are fragile in the sense that they have small capacity to absorb change without being profoundly altered and hence are potentially likely to suffer from impact (Report: IUCN/SCAR 1986). As the Antarctic is still less affected by human activities than other parts of the world, conservation programmes can start nearer the natural baseline than they would elsewhere. There is increased world interest in the expansion of tourism and exploitation of marine species and mineral resources. In order to avoid recurrences of uncontrolled exploitation that have repeatedly occurred elsewhere in the world, long-term conservation relymg on effective base-line studies is essential (Report: IUCN/SCAR 1986). The area of the Antarctic continent is about 14 000 000 square kilometres, comprising one tenth of the land surface of the earth. Of this, less than 3% is ever free of permanent snow and ice (Fig. 1.1). Over 50% of the continent is higher than 2000m with 25% being more than 3000 mail. The 8% of ice free ground is made up of exposed nunataks, permanent ice free areas, and areas that become free of snow during the summer melt period (Laws 1984). 2 The ice free areas of continental Antarctica were described as oases by A. Stephenson in 1936 (Pickard 1986). The term was included in western literature during the United States Navy ‘Operation Highjump’ in 1947 (Byrd 1947), The current theory on the formation and maintenance of oases, as reviewed by Pickard (1986) is that they formed as a result of the unusual orography of the terrain, combined with climate changes toward a general warming. Two essential conditions are suggested for the formation of an oasis. There must be a relatively high block of land with a retreating or thinning ice sheet. As the ice sheet lowers, the outward flow of ice is no longer over the block but around it. Ice above the block continues to lower but as it is not replenished, the rock 1s exposed. The cause of the lowering of the ice sheet is linked to global phenomena and the general holocene trend te warmer temperatures, Ice free areas are maintained by the low albedo of the exposed rock leading to a positive radiation balance. This warms the rocks which act as a heat source to melt any precipitation which is not blown away by wind. These oases then, are areas where temperatures can rise above freezing during the Antarctic summer, and consequently are places where plant and invertebrate life are to be found (Pickard 1986). The generai weather pattern for continental Antarctica is short cold summers followed by very long winters. Surface wind direction and strength is closely related to the direction and steepness of terrain. Katabatic winds draining the surface air of the interior are especiafly noticeable near the coast (Laws 1984}, th Atlantic Ocean ; : : yews Stilwell Hills T20°   onan tw ens Ross Dependency Figure 1.1: Map of the Antarctic continent with coastal oases highlighted. Various zones with distinctive climatic and biotic features have been described for the Antarctic. Holdgate (1970) describes four zones, the southern cold temperate, subantarctic, maritime or oceanic Antarctic, and continental Antarctic. Continental Antarctic has no phanerogamic vegetation and is considered south of the limit of extensive closed cryptogam communities (Holdgate 1970). Laws (1984) reviews the zonations described in the literature from 1904 to 1982 and in conclusion presents the same divisions with similar descriptive criteria, based primarily on the vegetation. In Laws’ (1984) classification continentai Antarctica is further subdivided: a. Coastal continental Antarctica is described as semi-desert with moss and algal vegetation present on ahumic soil but restricted in species and extent. Lichens are numerous and locally form extensive stands. Liverworts are very rare and invertebrates are locally abundant and diverse. This definition includes the coastal fringes of the continent and the ice free areas such as the Dry Valleys, of southern Victoria Land (Vincent 1988). b. Slope continental Antarctica is desert with mainly open, discontinuous lichen vegetation with occasional moss patches near rare snow. Some invertebrates are found. C. ice plateau continental Antarctica is described as having no life besides micro-organisms and stray birds (Laws 1984, Longton 1988). Lil Antarctic Terrestrial Flora Mosses and lichens dominate the Antarctic terrestrial macroflora (Laws 1884). Until recently taxonomic confusion has clouded the biogeographical status of many cryptogamic taxa. This is especially so on continental Antarctica where collection by specialists has been restricted to comparatively few areas. The bryophyte flora of Antarctica is comprised of some 70 mosses and 10 hepatic species. The majority of these are confined to the maritime Antarctic compared to which continental Antarctica is impoverished, with only six genera of mosses having been confirmed. These are Bryum, Ceratadon, Grimmia, Plagiothectum (one aquatic record), Pottia and Sarconeurum (Seppelt 1984). Bryum is the most widespread and abundant genus in the flora and arguably the most variable in morphoiogy. More species have been reported in this than any other genus (Seppelt and Kanda 1986). As latitude increases, the vegetation becomes sparser with fewer species and a comparatively smaller range of community types in a given area (Holdgate 1970, Laws 1984). Sporadic occurrences have been noted on some of the most southerly rock exposures 84° 35’ S and 86° 09’ S respectively (Laws 1984, Wise and Gressit 1965). An important factor determining bryophyte distribution in the Antarctic is adaptation to low temperature conditions. Mosses and lichens show stress resistance to temperature extremes and water doficionay, and have an ability for rapid reactivation of photosynthesis without a lag phase when conditions are suitable (Kallio and Kdrenlampi 1975). These characteristics are especially 6 relevant to Antarctic bryophytes which are effectively freeze dried during the winter period. Two other important factors have an effect on the terrestrial biota of all south polar regions. Geographical isolation from potential source of propagules and cool summers, reduce the survival potential of species which do manage to achieve the necessary ocean crossing (Laws 1984). The distribution of plants in the severe climatic regime of the Antarctic has been summarised by Holdgate (1970) as being dependant on a degree of shelter, a northerly aspect, adequate water supply in the growing season, direct, solar radiation and a stable substratum. Pickard (1986) suggests the distribution of plants on continental Antarctica is limited by the suitability of ice free niches and the availability of liquid water for growth during summer. The poikilohydric water economy of mosses restricta the season of photosynthetic activity, and therefore productivity. Because of these constraints, in continental Antarctica, mosses are only very locally abundant by lakes, streams, glaciers and snow banks which melt gradually throughout the summer, They occur iess extensively in hollows where blowing snow accumulates (Longton 1988). Steam warmed ground on Mt. Melbourne has also been recorded as supporting moss growth (Broady 1984, Broady et al. i987a), itis claimed that these discrete plant communities have low reproductive capacities and slow recovery rates. Consequently their ability to recolonise is small, For these reasons the habitats and their inhabitants are highly susceptible to the activities of humans (Greene et al. 1967). 7 Broadscale mapping and description of vegetation has been carried out for a few locations in continental Antarctica. Sites where more detailed studies have occurred are listed by Given (1988). These are Yule Bay and Lilhe Glacier, Cape Hailet, Terra Nova Bay and Wood Bay, Ross Island, Dry Valleys, Blue Glacier and Garwood Valley. In addition Given (1988) suggests reasons why the Ross Dependency may hold particular botanical interest. These include the unique habitats of the Dry Valleys, the development of vegetation on geothermally heated soils, the wide range of rock types and suitable plant sites, and the relative accessibility of the dependency. {ttl Antarctic Terrestrial fauna There are no true terrestrial vertebrates in Antarctica and the macroscopic fauna is therefore dominated by arthropods. Microscopic invertebrates dominate in areas which are seasonally free of snow caver (Laws 1984). Dougherty and Harris (1963),in one of the earhest modern investigations into freshwater microfauna, describe the multicellular microfauna in freshwater bodies of Ross Island and the nearby continental coast of Victoria Land as having thriving populations of rotifera, nematoda, tardigrada and turbelleria (platyhelminthes), Laws (1984) reviews relevant literature up to 1982 on terrestrial invertebrates in Antarctica. He hsts the main groups of species which have been identified from continental Antarctica as protozoa, rotifera, nematoda, tardigrada and arthropoda. Not included in this list are 3 platyhelminthes which do not appear to have been reported in continental Antarctica since Dougherty and Harris (1963). Since these earliest reports the focus of terrestrial invertebrate studies has been on the arthropods, particularly in the maritime Antarctic. The interactions between arthropeds and plants has been investigated in the maritime Antarctic zone (Block 1985, Booth and Usher 1984, Usher and Booth 1984, 1986), but similar investigations on continental Antarctica are fewer in number. Pickard (1986), reviews recent developments in terrestnal invertebrate studies in the Vestfold Hills and Miller et al. (1988) studied the terrestrial tardigrada inhabiting algae, lichens and mosses in the Vestfold Hills. Hveritt (1981) noted rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes, protozoans and bacteria associated with algal mats in Deep Lake Tarn in the Vestfold Hills. Suren (1989) studied microfauna associated with meltpools of the Ross ice Shelf. Corresponding maritime studies for freshwater ecosystems are reported by McInnes and Ellis-Evans (1987, 1988). Nematode species have been described from the McMurdo Sound region (Timm 1971, Wharton and Brown 1989}. LIV Coastal oases Ice free areas of coastal continental Antarctica sre not only the areas where relatively abundant plants and invertebrates are found but are also the regions which receive the major attention in terms of tourism, exploration and modern scientific expeditions. Two oases in coastal, continental East Antarctica, which have been the focus of biological studies, are the Vestfoid Hills in Princess Elizabeth Land, and the Dry Valleys in southern Victoria Land, Ross dependency (Fig. 1.1). - The Dry Valleys encompass an area of about 5000 square kilometres with a maximum elevation of greater than 2000 m. The valleys are large features in the Transantarctic Mountains, one of the largest mountain ranges on earth. In contrast the Vestfold Hills, at a latitude of around 68° 35’S, are a smaller area of lower lying ground, termed a low coastal oasis (Pickard 1986). A substantial amount of biclogical research has been completed in the Dry Valley area and the Vestfold Hills. While the topography and the latitude of the Vestfold Hillis vary markedly from the Dry Valleys it is convenient to make comparisons between these two oases. ‘The importance of free water associated with warmer temperatures for plant growth has been emphasised (Pickard 1986, Laws 1984) and this condition is met in the Dry Valleys by melt: water streams which are characterized by a highly variable flow regime at diel, seasonal and annual timescales (Vincent and Howard-Wilhams 1986). 19 In winter, plants in the Dry Valleys become ‘freeze-dried’ and therefore only poikilohydric plants such as mosses, lichens and terrestrial algae form the Dry Valley communities. Thompson (1980) listed the type of plant growth that could be found in the Dry Valleys. He classified them as edaphics (mainly algae), sublithics Gncluding Bryum antarcticum and Bueilia frigida), epilithic, chasmolithic and endolithic lichens. Cryptoendolithic ichens have been described as the dominant form of life in the Dry Valley region by Friedmann (1982) who suggests that algae and lichens are the only terrestrial plants found in the Dry Valleys. In contrast Green (1986) states that bryophytes are the most abundant terrestrial plants where water is available, Although it is widely known to scientists who have visited the area, that mosses can be locally abundant, literature on the presence and distribution of mosses in the Dry Valleys is searce. Mosses have been reported from the Taylor Valley (Greenfield and Wilson 1981, Green 1986), and from a variety of places in the Garwood Valley near the Hewchin and Joyce glaciers (Broady et al.1987b). Water flushed areas on valley slopes, channels of melt streams and areas below glacier ice cliffs supported these growths. I:V Sites of Special Scientific Interest Within the Ross Dependency a number of Sites of Special Scientafie Interest (8.5.5.1) have been designated. These are in place to provide a measure of protection to certain areas, while permitting research to be carried out under specific management plans. Hence associated ecosystems and il organisms are actively conserved and/or other forms of research where permitted by the management plans are facilitated. There are three such areas within the Dry Valleys. These arein the Asgaard Range, Barwick Valley and the Taylor Valley. The Taylor Valley (Fig. 1.2), generally lies in an east-west direction. The Taylor Glacier enters the head of the valley and numerous other giaciers flaw over the north and south facing slopes. The 8.5.8.1. in the valley encompasses an area of lkm sq between the tongue of the Canada glacier and the shoreline of Lake Fryxell (Fig. 1:3) and is termed 5.8.8.1. number 12 (New Zealand Antarctic Operations Manual 1989). During the summer months small meltwater streams drain from the glacier to the lake creating an extensive area of flushes. Much of the meltwater first drains into the Canada Pond adjacent to a low lying area of the glacier edge. The pond is frozen toe the bottom in winter but thaws completely during the summer of most years. The 8.8.8.1. was designated to protect an area of some of the richest algal and moss growth - g0 far found im the Dry Valleys. The site is considered the centre for terrestrial and freshwater biological research and a reference site for other Dry Valley _ biological ecosystems (New Zealand Antarctic Operations Manual 1989). The area encompassed by the 8.8.5.1 has come under review during the summer of 1989/90. The New Zealand Antarctic ResearchProgramme hut was sited within the 8.8.8.1. and Antarctic Division D.S.1R. requested that comment be made, by our expedition, on the huts relocation. The result was that the hut was moved durme November 1989, and new boundaries were proposed te include a 164° E ene Ross Sea 1 Gye ) } C.

L:VI Objectives of the study The fieldwork for this study was carried out in the Antarctic from 14.11.89 to 11.12.89. In view of the fragility of these ecosystems care was taken to mimimise our impact by keeping sampling to a mimmum, and to restrict movement within the area to strictly defined paths. Subsequent laboratory analysis of samples was conducted at Waikato University in the early part of 1990. The study was completed at the Taupo Research Laboratory, D.5.1.K., Taupe, New Zealand. The areas investigated were the Canada Glacier / Lake Fryxell bryophyte flushes in the Taylor Valley and the area of Cape Geology, Botany Bay and the Flatiron at Granite Harbour (Fig. 1.2).. The first was the major focus of the study and therefore received greater attention to detail (objectives 1 to 4}. The observations at Granite Harbour are a result of a qualitative survey of the area Spanning two and a half days (objective 5). 15 The objectives of the study were: To determine the locations of the pliant communities, their community structure, floristic composition, biomass and nutrient status. The 1989 study of plants in S.S.S.1. No.12 focused on obtaining a definitive species list as identifications have not been confirmed from the location before. To determine the invertebrate groups present, their abundance and to ascertain how invertebrate occurrence was related to vegetation community types. To determine relationships between community composition (plants and invertebrates) and environmental factors, in particular topography and water, To assess the capacity of these ecosystems to recover from external disturbances, To compile a plant species list from Granite Harbour and to describe how the composition of communities at this site compared te that of the Canada Glacier/ Lake Fryxell 5.8.8.1. flushes. 16 Chapter Ti: Study Sites, Materials and methods. ii: Taylor Valley: Site Description and Climate. The areas of bryophyte growth, which were the focus of the majority of this thesis, were located in 5.8.5.1. No. 12 adjacent to the eastern face of the Canada Glacier (77° 38’ 5,163° 00’ E), in the Taylor Valley approximately 12 km from the sea . The Canada Glacier is a local alpine glacier as distinct from the lerge outlet glaciers draining the polar ice sheet, or a coastal piedmont glacier lying along the coastline. The smaller alpine glaciers are all dry based. These dry based glaciers are effectively incapable of basal erosion and flow slowly as there is no basal sliding. Chinn (1986) presented evidence that the Canada glacier had been advancing aver the previous five or six years. There are 3 main flow directions of water off the Canada Glacier during the Antarctic summer and it is associated with these flows that the main plant prowth is found. The occurrence of wet algal-rich spongy flushes adjacent to the foot of a glacier where streams form is a frequent occurrence in the Dry Valley area (Howard-Williams and Vincent 1986). The flush areas at the Canada Glacier can be described as ’short turf’. These are systems formed by sparingly branched acrocarpous mosses with main shoots erect and parallel. The colonies may be loose or more frequently compact, greater than Zcm tail and often composed of Bryum and Potita (Longton 1988). 17 Two main areas of plant growth were identified for this study and were termed the ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ flush (Fig. 2.1). The lower flush is included in the present boundaries of the 3.5.5.1.. Its source stream runs in a north east direction off the face of the glacier toward the Canada Pond and contributes to the Fryxell stream. The area we termed the lower flush was that delimited by the extent of plant growth. It was approximately 130 metres long and 55 metres wide. The main stream flowing on to the flush divided in two, 45 metres downstream from the glacier, and rejoined 30 metres further down narrowing to a 10 metre wide strip draining into the Canada Pond (Photograph 1). In the summer of 1989/90 the amount of water flowing over the plants increased as the melt progressed, and eventually many of the bryophytes in lower lying areas were completely submerged (Photograph 2). The upper flush 1s included in the revised $.8.5.1. boundaries. Water is supplied to this area from a few hundred metres length of the upper north facing edge of the Canada Glacier. This is the beginning of the Fryxell stream which rapidly increases in size along the first kilometre as streams contribute from various portions of the glacier (Howard-Williams et al. 1986). The Fryxell stream is one of three which dominate the hydraulic budget of the receiving waters of Lake Fryxell (Green et al. 1989). Water which is sourced from the glacier and flows over the plants in the flushes, is likely to be the major source of nutrients to the system (Downes et al. 1986).

(1986) measured nutrients in the upper and lower part of the Fryxell stream during January 1984, and noted that inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations decreased markedly downstream. It was concluded that the significant algal growths in the area stripped nutrients from _ the water flowing over them. The Dry Valleys’ warm temperatures and persistent up and down valley winds help keep the area substantially free of snow in summer. The winters are characterised by long periods of cool calm weather interspersed with periods of warm, westerly katabatic gales (Vincent 1988). Polar microclimates are greatly affected by wind and the paucity of shelter for plants and animals limits their distmbuhon. There are three primary wind effects. These are disturbance of local temperature and humidity profiles, abrasion damage by transport ofice and mineral particles, and transport of living propagules (Laws 1984). fn the Antarctic all terrestrial plants and micro-organisms live close to the ground. The special microclimate at this level in relationship to air temperature at higher levels is illustrated in igure 2.2. An overall higher temperature for moss and lichen surfaces is evident compared to air temperatures at 0.6 metres and 1.5 metres. At S.8.S.1, No.12 a number of factors combine to provide a suitable microclimate for plant growth. The glacier provides protection from strong katabatic westerly winds and thereby oO ” AG am no yO w Qi E @ Et ~2 | I November , December January 1963 1963 1964 LOGS eee Air 1.5m ecscerseees. Figure 2.2: Daily maximum temperatures at four levels at Bir . GM cteecstetcoe Cape Hallet from Greene et al. (1967). GG Zed reduces abrasion of the plants, warm summer temperatures are attained at moss level and water is available from glacial melt. Extreme cold is the major feature of Antarctic environments. Even throughout the summer air temperatures at the margin of the continent lie between -10 and 15° celsius (Vincent 1988). Since 1985 continuous records of meterological data have been collected from within five nlometres of the study site at the Canada glacier. The meterological station is situated at Lake Hoare on the edge of a small peninsula 300m west of the Canada Glacier (Clow et al. 1988). In the year preceding this study daily average temperatures were above zero only within December 1988 and January 1989. They fell to below -40° celsius at times between May and August 1989 (Fig. 2.3). Relative humidity showed little change in overall trend throughout the year, fluctuating between extremes of approximately 30 and 80% (Fig. 2.4). For approximately four months of the year the site is subject to continual darkness (Fig. 2.5), With the return of sunlight during the summer months a diurnal cycle in photosynthetic quantum flux is evident. Throughout the year air temperature ciosely follows incident sunlight. Meltwater stream ecosystems in the Dry Valleys are fundamentally linked £ radiation and temperature. There is a strong correlation between mean daily discharge and the seasonal radiation cycle.

As a consequence small shifts in energy balance at glacier ice faces may markedly alter the availabihty of water for biota in these ecosystems. As water flow off the glacier is affected by changes in incident radiation, itis consequently extremely variable on ali scales from hours to years. Figures from the Onyx River in the Wright Valley illustrate variations in discharge related to changes in the radiation balance at the glacier face and emphasise the variability in annual discharge between years (Fig. 2.6). It follows that plant communities might provide an integrated assesament of water reliability and volume in an area, because of their reliance on this water for growth. {i:IE Site Description and climate, Granite Harbour Granite Harbour is located at 77° 00’ S, 162° 50’ E (Fig. 1.2). Ice free areas on the coast provide suitable habitats for plants and invertebrate colonisation (Fig. 2.7). Granite Harbour was named by Scotts party in January 1902. The area was noted as being well protected from the wind and enclosed by much bare rock capable of absorbing the suns’ rays. Small streams of water were described as meandering over stones with banks of almest luxurious mosses in their sheltered courses (Murray 1929). Coloured lichens, ‘good sized’ clumps of ‘real’ green moss, and plentiful collembola were noted in Edward Wilsons’ diary (Savours 1966). On November 30, 1911, the western aeologi cal party from the Terra Nova came to a small sheltered beach east of Cape Geolory.

Witson Piedmont Glacier GG 30 Because of the lichens and moss which they found growing here in ’some abundance’ they named it Botany Bay (Quartermain 1967). During this expedition they constructed a kitchen of granite blocks roofed with a sledge, biscuit boxes and sealskins. Much of this (including the sealskins) remains today (photograph 3). During our visit in 1989 we noted that the north facing sites of Cape Geology and Botany Bay are fed by numerous streams running down the steep granite faces. The streams are fed by part of the Wilson-Piedmont glacier above and are possibly enriched by the presence of a skua rookery. Ryan and Watkins (1989) concluded that nutrients in ornithogenic products had direct causal effects on the abundance and dispersion of the biota of inland Antarctic nunataks. Plant growth at this site contrasted with that at the Canada Glacier in that there was no well defined fiush area and the plants grew amongst pranite boulders. On Cape Geology most plant growth was found in the narrow catchments of the streams or on granite ledges where snowmelt and windbiown deposits provided the water and substrate necessary for prowth. In Botany Bay a comparatively wider area of less steep slope next to the sea allowed water from the streams to spread out amongst the boulders creating an expanse of suitable habitats extending approximately 50 to 100 metres along the beach. Mosses and lichens have been collected in the past from the Granite Harbour region. These have been identified as Bryum argenteum Hedw. , B. antarcticum Hook.f et Wils., Sarconeurum glaciale (C. Mull.) Card. et Bryhn, ol Photograph 3. Scotts kitchen at Granite Harbour. oe Lecanora griseomarginata, Rinodina frigida and Usnea antarctica, Algae of the genera Prasiola, Zygnema, Navicula, Nostoc and Phormidium have also been reported (Ugolini 1977). Climatic conditions in the Granite Harbour region have been interred from meteorological stations at other sites in the McMurdo region. Ugeolini (1977) estimated from isotherms delineating the area, that the mean annual temperature for the Kar Plateau on the north side of Gramte Harbour is probably between -20.0 and - 25° celsius. He judged from the amount of snow on the ground in October 1969 that the precipitation is probably higher than for other ice free areas of Southern Victoria Land. The Kar Plateau has an average elevation of 600 metres and as such is substantially higher than our study site which was within 100 metres of sea level. Air temperatures for 1924 November 1969 fluctuated between -8 and +2° celsius, and for 24-26 October 1969 from -10 to -80° celsius (Ugolini 1977). Records kept by two New Zealand research parties in the Granite Harbour region over the summer of 1983/1984 note a range of temperatures from -14° celsius on October 11 to -2° celsius on December 4. These readings were usually taken between 0700 and 1000 hours. A maximum windspeed of 30 knots was recorded on one day in early October. Wind speeds were otherwise generally less than 10 knots (Pyne 1984). od In:ili Methods IisithT Microclimate on the Canada Glacier Bryophyte flush. A Campbell CH21 datalogreer was set up on the lower bryophyte flush with three probes attached toit, These logged continuously at fifteen minute intervals for just over three weeks. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR 400-706nm) was measured with a Li 190sh quantum sensor to an accuracy of 0.1 uM m-?/sec. The logger was programmed to record maximum, minimum and average P.A.R. over the preceding fifteen minutes. A combination temperature and humidity probe was placed at 4 cm above the moss bed and another temperature probe was pushed lem into the moss. Relative humidity was measured to 0.1% and temperature to 0.1° celsius. The response of the humidity sensor is such that only trends can be taken from the data. Absolute values can be several % in error. Air temperature and moss temperatures were also measured using a hand held ‘Fluke’ digital thermometer over 4 diel periods at two hourly intervals during November and December 1989. The air temperature was measured at approximately 10 cm above the moss. The temperatures within a bed of Bryum argenteum (for sites see Fig. 2.8) were measured at depths of §, 10 and 15 mm.

Oo W:Hi:tE Frozen ground. On 3 days during November and December (17.11, 24.11, 8.12) the depth of frozen ground was estimated on three transects spanning the lower flush (fig. 2.8). This was measured by pushing a steel measuring rod into the ground until it could be pushed no further. Care was taken to detect fake readings from buried rocks. H:iHisHi Plant Taxonomy There 1s considerable confusion surrounding the taxonomy of the bryophytes of continental Antarctica. Bryum is both the largest genus and the one that raises the most taxonomic questions. It is considered that only through taxonomic revision and controlied environment growth studies will the number of moss species in continental Antarctica be clarified (Seppelt 1983). Previous records from the Canada Glacier bryophyte flushes reported Bryum argenteum and Bryum antarcticum (Green 1986) but recently the identification of Bryum antarcticum has come under review ( Kanda 1981, Seppelt and Kanda 1986). We were fortunate to have Rod Seppelt from the Australian Antarctic Division with us who has wide experience in the taxonomy of Antarctic bryophytes. His identification of bryophytes in the field enabled us to compile a species list in light of recent taxonomic reviews. ILHLIV Vegetation of the lower flush (Initial mapping). Collections of representative plant specimens were made from both the lower and upper flushes. The lower flush was mapped by establishing a five 36 metre grid. A survey line was established on the western side of the flush and measuring tapes run perpendicular to it, across the flush, at five metre intervais. The elevations along the survey line and across the flush were measured with a builders theodolite. This was also used to ensure that lateral tapes were at right angles to the main survey ine. The boundaries of major plant associations were drawn and a visual! estimation of cover made within these boundaries. An overall map was produced at a scale of 1:100. I:Hi:V Verification of cover estimates To establish the accuracy of the visual cover estimates, point quadrats were examined at a number of areas over the flush. A quadrat 10cm x 20cm divided into Icm squares was subjectively sited on the flush to cover the range of vegetation perceived to be present. At each cm intersect within the quadrat the plant species was noted. Within each community type between 2 and 10 quadrats were investigated. The % cover of each species in each quadrat, and the mean % cover within each plant community was derived from these figures. Transects were laid across the main flow channel! at five locations on the lower flush. The microtopography of these transects was mapped using a theodolite. The heights were not surveyed with regard to a standard reference point but their relationship to the overall contours of the flush is illustrated in the results section. The height of the ground and the plant species present were noted at five cm intervals along the transect. The data from the transects was subsequently divided into 20 cm intervals for the purpose of analysis. Each of these intervals was regarded as a site, and chi squared analysis was 37 carried out to determine a degree of association between plant species. Each site was designated as a hummock or a hollow from the tepographic survey data. TID:Vi Nutrients For each of Pottia, B. argenteum and Nostoc associations, 5 x 1 cm diameter cores were taken from 3 different sites (Fig. 2.8) to be used for nutrient analysis. A stainless steel cork borer was used to core to the depth where the plant material met the substratum. This was to a depth of approximately 15 mm for the mosses but less for the algae. The cores were placed in glass vials and kept frozen until they were dried after return to New Zealand prior to analysis. To obtain the minimum required weight for this analysis, the 5 core samples were bulked. Nutrient analysis was carried out by the Plant Analysis Laboratory, M.A.F., Hamilton. Nitrogen and phosphorus were analyzed using a Kjeldahl digest with selenium as a catalyst. Nitrogen was analyzed by a modified Gehrke-Wall automated method, while phosphorus was analyzed by an automated method using an ammonium molybdenate and amino napthal sulphuric acid reaction. The remaining nutrients were analyzed using a nitricperchloric mixed acid, wet ashing procedure. The digests were diluted with strontium chloride solution to inhibit the formation of stable calcium and magnestum phosphates, sulphates and aluminates in the flame. These diluted solutions were then anaiyzed on a four channel flame spectrophotometer using atomic absorbtion for the magnesium channel and flame emission for sodium, potassium and calcium. 38 H:ifi:Vif Biomass To obtain an estimate of the biomass of the plants an additional set of cores was taken adjacent to the first set. Each individual core was dried for 1 week at 50° celsius and then weighed. Many of the samples had a high sand content so for all the samples ash free dry weights were caiculated. The samples were placed in a furnace for 2 hours at 550° celsius. After cooling in A desiccator the material remaining after ashing was weighed on an OHAUS GT480 digital balance. This weight was subtracted from the initial dry weight to obtain an estimate of the above ground biomass. The results were extrapolated to biomass/unit area assuming continuous cover (Longton 1988). . No distinction was made between green and decaying material. TL:HiVUE Vegetation of the Upper flush The upper flush was mapped on a broad scale to compare the vegetation with that of the lower flush, 45 transects were placed across the flush at 10m intervals starting at the Canada pond and working northward. The major boundaries of plant groups were marked at each 10m interval. Percent covers were not estimated due to the great variability on this large scaie. Wir Epilithic Lichen Mapping At the outwash area of the Canada Pond, an area containing epilithic lichens was discovered. Lichen distribution was mapped in relation to water depth using a similar method to that used for the lower flush. Two parallel og 30 m tapes were laid out in a line with the river flow and enclosing the entire outwash area, Two further 30 m tapes were then placed across the stream at a distance of one metre apart. The number of lichens could be counted in each one metre square by moving along the tapes. When each transect had been completed the upper tape was lifted and moved downstream, one metre below the remaining tape, and the assessment proceedure repeated. A total distance of 15 m was mapped slong the stream. A microtopographic survey was also made. Lichens were recorded by an abundance index fully explained in the results section. Tis Recovery To obtain a measure of the ability of the lower flush to recover from damage we relocated plant and animal sampling sites which were still recognizabie after a period of 10 years. Damape was initially located by careful observations of the flush. Sites were marked on a site map and where possible, were then surveyed enabling a scale map to be produced. A simple map available from 1980 allowed old paths to be relocated on the flush whilst small cairns indicated sampling sites. Excluding paths and footprints, a total of nineteen damaged sites were identified and, of these, nine were confirmed as to type and date of damage. 40 TSIiEXT Invertebrates Samples for invertebrate enumeration were taken from the lower flush by the coring method described for the plant samples. These cores were placed in ‘whirl-paks’ (NASCO Ltd) and kept frozen until they were examined. Invertebrate numbers were recorded from samples taken in November before the melt began. Animals were not active within the flush at this time and these counts are therefore an indication of the potential inoculum which would become active as soon as water was available. Numbers were also recorded from samples taken after meltwater had been on the flush for 14 days (8-10.12.89). Abundances per square metre were calculated from 27 pre-melt lem diameter cores and 17 posi-melt cores. Most of the samples were counted in the field but some were retained frozen and transported back to New Zealand. For invertebrate enumeration the cores were sectioned into 3 layers, 5 mm thick, wetted and left at approximately 2° celsius for 1 hour before counting. While in the field inifial counts were made at intervals for a 24 hour period to establish a minimum time to leave the sample before counting. A time course plot of invertebrate numbers (Fig. 2.9) was used to determine the minimum period required to maintain a sample in the wetted state before counting the invertebrates in this and all subsequent experiments. One hour was decided on as there was littls change in numbers of active invertebrates _ over the following time period up to 24 hours. In practice the time varied between one and two hours as some samples were more time consuming than others to count. 41 Go we) A 71 Sample b. 20 4 Wetting peried chosen Number of active invertebrates on   Time {hours} Figure 2.9: Invertebrate counts over time following wetting of a freeze dried moss core, AZ The small size of the samples made it possible to count the total number of animals in each core by teasing apart the plant material, in a thin layer of water. This was done in a channelled perspex counting tray (channel width 10mm). Animals which were visibly moving were counted under a dissecting microscope 650). Ti: «Granite Harbour Investigations at Granite Harbour were carried out from 4.12.89 to 7.12.89. Representative plant samples were taken from Geology bay, Botany bay and from the Flatiron. The plants were identified to obtain a species list and invertebrates were extracted in the same manner as described for Fryxell samples. No quantitative analysis of invertebrate numbers was attempted “here. One stream catchment was surveyed in relative detail as to plant composition, The area Hes on what could be termed the boundary between Geology bay and Botany bay. The catchment was drawn to scale and a visual impression of changing plant species composition was noted from the snow bank at the highest point dewn to the ocean, Physical characteristics were noted. Samples were taken at 6 sites in this area to be examined for the presence of invertebrates. Chapter ITi: Climate and microclimate: Lake Fryxell area. Ril Introduction: Ibis accepted that in the Antarctic uiicroclimate zones occur close tc the ground which may be crucial to the existence of biota. It is considered that in 5.5.5.1, No.12, a number of factors asseciated with the Canada Glacier combine to provide a favourable microclimate to enable the continuation of plant growth in the area. In order to describe microclimate characteristics close to the ground ort the iower flush, air temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation were measured over the entire study period. The depth of frozen pround was measured on three occasions anc moss temperature was measured over four diel periods. This chapter presents results from microclimate observations on the lower flush adjacent to the Canada Glacier during November and December LO89. TRAGi Results LG Climate Temperature recordings at 4 cm above the moss lor a 15 day period from 24,11.89 to 10.12 895, are illustrated in Figure 3.1.

Temperature fluctuations are illustrated in Figure 3.2 over four diel periods. A consistent diel fluctuation is evident with an obvious increase in average temperature as the summer progresses. During the hours of 2200 and 0400 when the air temperature drops to the lowest level of the diel period, moss temperature consistently remains higher than air temperature. The capacity of the moss to buffer against air temperature changes means that during these diel study periods the mosses had a higher average temperature overall than the air temperature. As the water flow increased over the flush, temperature differences which had been observed at different depths within the moss, ceased to be obvious. Figure 3.3 shows the relative humidity (R.H.) at moss level for the period 24.11.89 to 10.12.89. While the moisture content of the air close to plant communities has been little studied, data in the Hterature all show increasing moisture gradients down toward the ground with R.H. maxima usually occurring at night (Laws 1984). R.H, maxima at night are evident from Figure 3.3. Higher R.H. due to lower temperatures is evident on comparison of Figures 3.1 and 3.3 around the 27th November (day 12) and the 7th December (day 22).

Comparison of Figure 3.4 (datalogger) and Figures 3.2 ¢ and d (diels) illustrates the relationship between P.A.R. and temperature. The first period of 28/29 November was a clear day and although this was early in the summer before water was flowing over the whole flush, moss temperatures reached more than 12° celsius on the afternoon of the 29th (Fig. 3.2), P.ALR. levels reached a maximum of 1500 uM m-?s-1. In comparison the period of 7/8 December was a partially overcast day with a maximum P.A.R. of 1720 pM m 8-1, By this part of the summer moss temperatures were often around 0 ° celsius and meltwater covered the flush for much of the day, but the lower overall ight levels appear to have precluded the maximum temperature exceeding 9° celsius. A significant increase in air and moss temperature over the course of the day can be seen between 15/16.11.89 and 22/23.11.89 (Fig, 3,2) at which stage meltwater became visible on the flush itself (Fig. 3.5 and photograph 4). Over the following week the amount of water flowing onto the flush waxed and waned as temperatures fluctuated above and below zero, and with cloudy and clear skies, but by the 7th of December water was flowing over the entire flush. This correlates to extended periods when the air temperature remained above zero. Water level at the site of transects 1, 2,3 and 5 on the 10.12.89 is shown on the transect profiles illustrated in chapter IV. a0 ° eaey / Le f 1 #@> f a, ' i } f ¢ ff rt Le wm 23,114,833 ene 24-75,13.89 mpm 5.12.89 Complete cover 7.12.89 0 2O iM] ween awe Figure 3.5: Changes in the wetting front observed on the lower flush m the early stages of glacial meltwater flow. ol Photograph 4.

Wii: Frozen ground An effect of increasing scil temperature on the flush is the increase in depth of substrate to the frozen ground layer (Fig. 3.6). A general pattern of deepening of the frozen ground layer can be observed, This deepening of the : frozen layer would imply an additional source of water being available to the plants as more water entered the liquid state. The large increase in depth between 24 .11 .89 and 8 .12 .89 (Fig. 3:6 } corresponds to increasing air temperatures (Fig. 3:1) and the associated increased amount of free water flowing over the flush. 53   5 15 25 35 ay Distance {m) Figure 3.6: A representative transect illustrating the change in depth. of frozen ground across the whole flush. o4 Chapter IV: Vegetation: Lake Fryxell S.S.8.1./Canada Glacier IV:l Introduction Two areas of plant growth adjacent to the Canada Glacier were investigated during this study. A bryophyte species list was compiled and the presence of algae was noted. The distribution of plants in areas such as the Dry Valleys is highly dependent on the availability of water during the summer season. In light of this, the patterning of plant species in relation to water flow was analyzed in detail on the lower flush, and investigated on a broad scale on the upper flush. In this chapter vegetation maps of both areas are presented, accompanied by a detailed analysis of species composition and percent cover on the lower flush. Results from analysis of biomass and nutrient content are mcluded. The presence of lichens at this relatively low altitude site is noted with a description of their distribution in relation to water level in the Fryxell stream. iV:if Results IV:Ii:1 Plant Species This section outlines plant species described from flush areas adjacent to the eastern edge of the Canada Glacier. oD MOSSES Bryum argenteum Hedw. Bryum. pseudotriguetrum (Hedw.) Gaertn. Pottia heimti Qdedw.) Feurnr. B. argenieum is one of the few truly cosmopolitan moss species. Seppelt (1984) notes that many Antarctic specimens tend to lack the characteristic siivery-green colour of the leaf tips, however achiorophyilous leaf tips were evident on the Fryxeil specimens. It was noted that in the freeze dried state, patches of B. argenteum turf had lifted away from the substrate over the winter period. This is the first record for Bryum pseudotrigutrum from this area although it is considered to be widespread in the Antarctic region (Seppelt and Kanda 1986}. The plants occurred scattered amongst the B. argenteum. Seppelt (1986) notes that B. pseudotriquetrum is widely scattered in the eastern half of the Vestfold Hilis but that extensive beds are uncommon. Seppelt (1984) considers B. pseudotriquetrum to be synonymous with B. algens. 56 Pottia heimii has been referred to in the past as B. antarcticurn. Records of B. antarcticum are now considered to be synonymous with P. heimii (Kanda 1981). P. heimii can be divided into two growth forms. The first is healthy looking moss growing adjacent to channelled areas or where there is available seepage water. The second type is termed ’encrusted’ Pottia, This has a dry unhealthy appearance due to salt precipitation on the surface. Vincent (1988) reports that Antarctic soils have an unusually high sali content which may include calcium sulphate which often occurs as surface encrustations. Greenfield and Wilson (1981) collected freeze dried mosses from Cape Bird which were encrusted with a white crystalline deposit. This was found, on analysis, to contain 35 % sodium, 0.4 % magnesium, 2.2 % potassium and 0.8 @ calcium. They suggest this is probably wind blown salt, deposited on snow cover and further deposited on these mosses by evaporation. The accumulation of soluble salts is a feature of desert regions in which evaporation exceeds precipitation and where soils are not flushed by meltwater. This implies that these encrusted Pottia areas only receive water by percolation up from the sediment below . LICHENS Sarcogyne sp. Caloplaca citrina GHoffm. Th. Fr. od Carbonea capsulata (Dodge and Baker) Hale comb.nov. Lecanora expectans Darb. These were noted in a small area near the outflow of the Canada Pond and identified by Dr. Rod Seppelt. ALGAE Broady (1981) has deseribed the algal communities which are an important component of the flora of the study area. He labelled the algal growths within the flush as “hydroterrestriai" due to the alternating wet and dry moisture relations. Three general communities were recogmsed by us in mapping and analysis of plant communities. These were a) Nostoc commune which forms large macroscopic mucilaginous colonies in wetter areas of the flush, Oscillatorian algae are associated. b) Red brown felt in the region of maximum and most frequent water flow. This is dominated by Oscillatorian algae. ¢) Epiphytic aleae over the surface of Bryum argenteum and Pottia hamit These are dominated by Nosfoc but include several Oscillatorian algae and Calothrix in wetter Bryum argenteum areas (Broady 1981). 58 IV:I:1I Initial mapping. Patterning of plant species is easily seen visually on the flush. Within the main channels of water flow Nostoec communities and associated Oscillatorian sp. dominate (Broady 1981). Bryum argenteum is found in areas of flowing water and seepage areas. Where water is flowing a high proportion of this moss has epiphytic Nestec communities associated withit. Moving out to the edges of the flowing water zones or to higher ground Pottia heimit dorninates. Figure 4.1 is the initial map of the lower flush showing obvious community boundaries. It was within these boundaries that estimates of % cover were made. Because subjective assessment of plant abundance contains a very large error, it will only give an approximate indication of abundance (Kershaw 1964). To avoid placing too much emphasis on this visual estimation the cover percentages were bulked into areas of >5 % cover to give a visual picture of distribution. Figure 4,2 illustrates the distribution of Nostoc colonies (not associated with bryophytes) (overlay 1), Bryum argenteum (>5 % cover) (overlay 2) and Pottia heimii (>5 % cover) (overlay 3). Bryum pseudotriquetrum is Included with B. argentewn. The maps overlay a general contour map of the flush on which the main lines of water flow are indicated (Mg. 4.3). The relationship of transect positions to the overall contours of the flush are also marked on figure 4.3. mayor weeele eat he — wom bare ground @ rocks / footpaths Figure 4,2: Over lay maps of each species at 5 % cover. overlay 1.

These give an indication of species composition within the broad cover estimates and suggest that the bulking of cover estimates into areas of >5% i8 an accurate indication of percent cover. The histograms drawn from Pottia areas of > 5 % cover (Fig. 4.4 a} indicate that B. argenteum was not prevalent at high % covers. Except for site 11 taken in an area of encrusted Pottia, epiphytic Nostoc was present at low percentages. No &. pseudotriquetrum was present in these quadrats. The histograms for the areas of B. argenteum >5 % (Fig. 4.4 b) show a greater mix of species. From the results B. argenteum appeared to have a broader range of habitats that it could occupy often overlapping the zones to which Pottia was restricted. Epiphytic Nostoc was more common on Bryum than on Pottia. Often the demarcation between communities was quite marked. By comparing histograms 3 and 4, which represent communities immediately adjacent to each other it can be seen that the species composition was completely different, This phenomenon was especially evident close to the raain channel, where there were large differences in the amount of water available to the plants. 65   Key:0l1.

The numbers of invertebrates obtained from counting individuals in moss cores were used to estimate abundance, and to present information on their distribution both horizontally and vertically throughout the moss bed. In order to analyze the invertebrate counts with respect to plant species present, and the microtopography of the flush, four ecological zones were assigned to each transect. These zones are based on visual observations of water flow over the transect and the corresponding plant patterning discernable from Figure 4.4. They are as follows: zone 1; Ares ofearliest meltwater. This is generally the lowest lying ground and is dominated by Nostoc, other algae and B.argenteum. Zone 2: Receives seepage meltwater during the early weeks of flow. Transition zone from B. argenteum to P. heimit. 31 Zone 3: Water only during full fow and mostly via seepage from adjacent areas. Dominated by P. heim. Zone 4: Driest area, dominated by ‘encrusted P. hetmii ’. ‘The encrustation implied water was evaporating from the moss surface after moving up from the substrate below. Rotifers, nematodes and tardigrades were investigated quantitatively to obtain a measure of their abundance and distribution across the flush. Three experiments were conducted in relation to invertebrate enumeration from moss cores, Results from these experiments are presented in this chapter. VEILI Experiments Experiment 1: The effect of increased temperature on invertebrate activity. in the laboratory at Waikato University an experiment was conducted to establish whether an increase in temperature of the mosses without the addition of water accelerated the onset of activity of the invertebrates inhabiting them. Moss cores were subjected to differing temperatures in a regime that correlated to diel measurements on the 28th and 29th of November of 1989 (Fig. 3.2). These diel temperature fluctuations were taken as bemg indicative of the temperature regime during the early part of the summer season. Initially five samples from transect three on the lower flush (at least one from each zone), were counted in the manner previously described (Treatment 1). Ten further samples were incubated under a temperature regime of 2° C for three hours per day and -5 to -10° C for the remaining twenty one hours over a period of three days. Five of these were then counted (Treatment 2). The remaining five samples were exposed further to 10° © for ten hours and 0 to 4° C for twelve hours over the following three days before being counted (Treatment 3). Analysis of variance was performed on the counts using the t-test (Minitab version). Experiment 2: Invertebrate abundance and distribution over the Bush. To obtain an estimation of the distribution of invertebrates across different plant community types, plant cores were taken across a variety of transects and the number ofinvertebrates in the cores were counted. Samples from transects 1, 2, 3, and 5 (Fig. 4.5) were used for the analysis. Cores were taken at intervals along the transects representing each zone. In order to sample each community type these were not randomly sampied. The most extensive sampling (14/15 November 1989) was prior to meltwater arriving on the flush (pre-melt}, but samples were also taken afler meltwater was present on the flush (post-melt). 93 Invertebrates were counted from one core per zone from each transect prior to the melt starting, enabling an estimate of abundance to be calculated. In order to establish whether there were significant differences in invertebrate numbers between each zone, the counts were analyzed using the non parametric Friedman test. This tests the null hypothesis (Ho) that each ranking of the random variables within a block is equally ikely, (i.e. the zones have identical effects) (Conover 1980). Minitab was used to rank the data used in the Friedman test. The minitab version of the Friedman test approximates the pvalue using the chi square distribution. Conover(1980) states that recent studies. show the F approximation to T2 as clearly superior to the chi squared approximation, so the F distribution has been used for my results. The alternative hypothesis (Ha) was that at least one of the zones tended to yield larger observed values than at least one other treatment. If the nuli hypothesis was rejected, multiple comparisons were carried out on zone pairs (Conover 1980} . The number of cores taken for post melt counts were not sufficiently spread over the flush to analyze using the Friedman test but these did enable a further estimate of invertebrate abundance to be calculated. 94 Experiment 3: Vertical distribution of invertebrates. The vertical distribution of rotifers, nematodes and tardigrades within the mosses was calculated from counts of each 5mm cross section of a core. This was done for both pre-melt and post-melt samples. The vertical distributions in 4 samples from each zone is summarized using the mean depth statistic (Usher and Booth 1984), given by D= ¥ ni (64 - 2.5) /Y ni =5 ( ¥ imi/ Sni )-2.5 Where ni is the number of invertebrates in the ith layer , i=1 for the top layer (central depth 2.5 mm) and i=3 for the bottom layer (centre at 12.5 mm), 5 = depth in mm of layer. Viti Results A species list of invertebrates isolated from plant samples during this study is presented in Table 6.1. Rotifers, nematodes, and tardigrades have been identified to genus level. (Dartnall and Hollowday 1985, Timm 1971, Dastych 1984). One specimen of Turbellaria was found at transect 5, zone 3 in a core of Nostoc over Bryum argenteum. The specimen was photographed at 100x and 400x mapnification (see photograph 5 aandb). From the photographs IJ have classified the specimen as being of the order Catenulida. Catenulids usually reproduce asexually forming chains of 2 to many zooids (Edmondson 1966). Part of a chain of zooids can be seen in the photograph. 95 Photograph 5. Platyhelminthe found in moss samples from the Canada Glacier bryophyte flush.   (b) 96 Mites were not found during the time in the Taylor Valley but were seen in samples which had been subject to warmer temperatures on return to New Zealand. The mites were only found in samples from transect 5 in the encrusted Pottia zone, and after they had been wetted for up to 10 days densities reached 23 individuals per lcm core. These are listed as Stereotydeus {Gressitt 1967) and although the identification has not been confirmed S. mollis has been identified from the flush previously (Strandtmann et al. 1973, Block 1985). Collembolans were not seen on either the upper or lower flush but were collected during a visit. to the north facing slopes of the Taylor Valley on the other side of Lake Fryxeil, Experiment 1: The effect of increased temperature on invertebrate activity. Figure 6.1 illustrates the numbers of individuals active after each temperature treatment. The highest mean number ofindividuals counted was li nematodes per core in treatment 2. There was no significant increase in numbers in numbers of active invertebrates (p = 0.5} between the three different température treatments. It would appear that the addition of water to the core at the time of counting _ was the stimulus for activity rather than solely a rise in temperature.

The zones which had significant differences between them according to this test are shown in Table 6.2.

Mosses grew on the smaller sized sand and gravel particles between larger rocks. All obvious plant life ceased at 30 m from the sea ice edge. Moss samples from the first three sites indicated in Figure 7.2 were analyzed for major elements. Concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and calcium are presented for each of the three mess samples. There is a general trend of increasing concentration of all nutrients downstream. The highest concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and calcium were found in the moss in flowing water which was also amongst skua perching and nesting sites. VU: Invertebrates Table 7.2 lists invertebrates seen during this visit to Granite Harbour. With a handlens collembolans were evident on the surface of the moss at most sites. They did not, however, appear to be present where water was flowing over the plants. Figure 7.2 incorporates a presence/ absence table for invertebrates, at the surveyed site. 1i3 TABLE 7.2: Invertebrate List: Granite Harbour Phytum a Genus Rotifera Philodina Habrotrocha Nematoda Plectus Tardigrada Macrobiotus Arachnida Stereotydeus Insecta Cryptopygus 1i4 Chapter VII: Discussion VIH:I Flora and Biomass Prior to this study no definitive plant species list had been recorded for the Lake Fryxell S.S.S.1. No. 12. B, argenteum and B. antarcticum had been reported for the area (Greenfield and Wilson 1981, Green 1986). B, pseudotriquetrum had not previously been recognised in this area. B. antarcticum is now considered to be synonymous with Pottia heimii by Kanda (1981). The so-called B. antarcticum from the Fryxell area has now been identified as Pottia heimii by Dr. Rod Seppelt (pers comm.) Seppelt and Kanda (1986) conclude that only two species of the genus Bryum namely B, argenteum and 8. pseudotriquetrum should be recognised in the continental Antarctic flora. The distribution of Nostoc, Pottia and B. argenteum on the lower Fryxell flush was correlated closely with the water regime ofthe area. The bryophytes had distinctive areas of optimum growth. Nosfoc grew in an opportunistic manner where there was sufficient water flow, which included epiphytic growth on bryophytes. | Ohtam and Kands (1987) suggest that the growth of prominent algal flora on moss colonies at Syowa Station might be caused by abundant water supply from the continental glacier during the summer season.They conclude that water availability and nutrient supply for moss growth largely influence the presence of epiphytic algae. LiS itis the freezing and melting cycle that exerts the dominant influence on Antarctic life forms, either directly or indirectly (Vincent 1988). While temperature may be of prime importance in determining the dominance of cryptogams in cold and frigid polar environments, water availability is of higher importance in controlling the distribution of cryptogamic growth both locally and regionally (Longton 1988). The importance of the interaction between incident radiation and temperature in determining the appearance and maintenance of meltwater flow has become evident from these results. Where the frozen ground iayer is shallow, ponding and waterlogging are common. This unfrozen water may be of preat irmportance to soil dwelling animals and plants (Laws 1984). The Canada Glacier 1s not only the source of meltwater crucial to plant growth but it also provides the necessary shelter from potentially destructive winds. Chinn (1986) suggests that because of their low erosion rates, dry based glaciers may act as protective cover against wind erosion of bare rocky slopes. The lower lying ground on the easterly side of the glacier where the flushes occur is protected from easterlies as the air rises up to pass over the glacier. The bulk of the glacier itself provides substantial protection from stronger katabatic winter westerly winds. The importance of microclimate has been noted by a number of workers (Greene et al. 1967, Laws 1984, Campbell and Claridge 1987 and Longton 1988). Laws (1984) states that the climate experienced at lower leveis has only a rather general relationship to standard meterological data emphasising that conditions close to the ground must be taken inte account when interpreting 116 climate effects on biota. Longton (1974) emphasised the mfluence of microclimate in determining. biomass and productivity by using microclimate data from different sites to estimate these parameters. A much longer plant species list was obtained for the Granite Harbour area than for the Fryxell flush. Distinct plant zonation could be seen fram the freshwater source to the ocean, Bryum growth continued to the seaward limit of plant distribution which correlates with observations by Ugohni (1977) who noted from studies at Kar plateau that B. argenteum appeared to be able to tolerate highly saline conditions, As there are no detailed records of climate from the Granite Harbour region it is difficult to make comparisons between the climate in this area and at the Canada Glacier site. Because this is a coastal site, it is not subject to up and down valley winds as is the Canada Glacier site in the Taylor Valley. The region of Cape Geology and Botany Bay where this study was conducted appeared to be protected to the south by the Wilson Piedmont Glacier and to a certain extent to the east by Discovery Bluff. The area of most extensive plant growth in Botany Bay was protected from westerly winds by Cape Geology. These factors may enhance the area as a favourable habitat for bryophyte and lichen colonisation. The nature of the rocks in the area provide an additional microclimate as described by Ugolini (1977) which he considers conducive to the establishment of life. In the Antarctic, biomass is low due to the scattered nature of the vegetation but it may be considerable within moss and lichen communities of 100% cover (Longton 1988}. This study reports biomass values ranging from 117 950 g to 1250¢ m-? for bryophytes making up the flushes at the Canada Glacier, which correspond to the values of 250 to 1500 g m-* reported for the flush by Greenfield (1981). They compare with reports of 1100 g¢ m-* in short moss turfs on Ross Isiand (Longton 1988) but are considerably larger than the 177 g m-* reported for B.aigens at Birthday Ridge by Kappen (1985). Stands of B.argenteum considered to be exceptional by Longton (1988) were recorded as having a biomass of 938 g m-?. My results are comparable to those reported for a Bryum algens/ Grimmia lawiana mix at Mawson Rock of 1100 g m-? for 100% plant cover (Seppelt and Ashton 1978), whose report however, refers to green biomass alone. The significance of the finding of lichens growing on the surfaces of rocks at the outwash area of the Canada Pond is emphasized by a statement by Frnedmann and Ocampo-Friedmann (1984). They state that the most striking feature of the McMurdo Upland (Dry Valleys) is the apparent absence of life, emphasising that the exposed surfaces of rocks are practically abiotic, except for the very infrequent, small patches of surface lichens im particularly sheltered microhabitats. Certainly the distribution of hchens at the Canada Pond appeared to be closely related to the microhabitat existing in the area. VOIRII Nutrient Composition There is no marked difference in the composition of major elements between mosses from the Canada Glacier flushes and the Granite Harbour sampies. The exception may be the higher value for nitrogen in the main flow Lig at the Granite Harbour site. Nutrient values for Nostec, Bryum, and Pottia from the Canada Glacier flushes can be compared with data obtained elsewhere. Nitrogen values from Fryxell are approximately 50% less than those presented for two mosses in the Arctic tundra (Chapin et al. 1980), Phosphorus and potassium values are approximately the same but calcium levels at the Canada Glacier are up to twice as high as those presented for Arctic species. Pickard (1986) presents nutrient data for moss beds with epiphytic Nestec at Mossel Lake in the Vestfold Hills. Vaiues range from 0.84% - 4.18% for nitrogen 9.064% - 0.076% for phosphorus and 0.260% - 1.86% for calcium. My data is within this range suggested for calcium however phosphorus values at the Canada Glacier would appear to be up to three times higher than moss beds at Mossel Lake. Nitrogen values from the Canada Glacier bryophytes are similar or slightly lower than at Mossel Lake. Pottia has the lowest nitrogen value. This may relate to it having less epiphytic Nostoc, as cyanobacteria growing apiphytically on mosses provide significant N fixation on damp mosses (Longton 1988). Itis the nutrients in soil moisture and surface runoif which appear to be of greatest significance to small plants growimg appressed to the substratum or those forming dense colonies. In these communities upward external movement of water cecurs by capillarity or due to humidity induced diffusion pradients (Longton 1988). Longton (1988) emphasises that the combined characteristics of nutrient cycling in polar ecosystems often result in available nitrogen and phosphorus being limiting and suggests that low rates of nitrogen cycling could impose 1i9 restrictions on production as severe as those attributable to direct effects of temperature on metabolism. Release of nutrients by chemical weathering is retarded by cold, particularly when combined with aridity and the same factors restrict N fixation. Rates of N cycling in polar systems are further depressed by slow flecomposition and the limited extent of herbivory which result in nutrients accumulating in an unavailable form in dissolved organic matter (D.O.M). Nutrient cycling is influenced to a large extent by water supply (Longton 1988). Downes et al.(i986) suggest that the dry non-living epilithon persisting from the previous summer in Dry Valley streams may provide a source of D.O.M. and particulate organic matter at first flows each year. Green et al. (1989) cite values of approximately 0.9 uM NO3-N for Fryxell stream, which, aithough one of the highest values they present for the area, is extremely low compared to other flowing waters of the world. HowardWilliams and Vincent (4989) present some physical characteristics for the Fryxell Stream including a comparison of nutrients at an upstream and downstream site (Table 8.1). Nitrogen and phosphorus values were much higher at the upstream site. Itis the water with these higher values that the mosses and algae received. 120 Table 8.1: Selected environmental features of four south Victoria Land streams (Howard-Williams and Vincent 1989).

While this 1s a transient phenomenon, Vincent and Howard-Wilhams (1986) suggest this initial pulse may be advantageous to stream flora which rapidly resumes metabohe activity on rehydration. 121 Howard-Williams et al.(1989) noted that nitrogen fixed by Nostoc mats of the Adams stream in the Miers Valley and the Fryxell Stream in the Taylor Valley ranged from 9-939 mg N m-*/year. A growth rate of 100 gm-? has been proposed for B. argenteum turfs on Ross Island (Longton 1988). With a nitrogen content of 0.82% (this study} then the nitrogen requirement of this moss would be 0.82 ¢ m-* /year (820mg). it may be possible that mitrogen fixation by Nosiec in the flush systems may be able to supply the entire nitrogen requirement of the mosses. it seems very unhkely that nitrogen could be liymitme te the mosses in this system because of: 1 the position of the mosses at water flows where nutrient levels are high 2) high nitrogen fixation by epiphytic and surrounding Nostoc and 3) slow growth rates implying a low nutrient requirement. In relation to algal growth in Dry Valley streams, Howard-Williams et al. (1986) suggested that the physical features of streams seemed to be of greater importance than nutrients in determining biological activity. It is possible that the presence of a skua rookery at the Granite Harbour site may affect nutrient availability for plants in this area. Work by Ryan and Watkins {1989) at the Robertskollen nunataks in western Dronning Maud Land, suggested that while fine scale dispersion patterns of plants were determined primarily by physical factors affecting water avaiulabity, coarse scale analysis showed significant responses along the bird influence pradient. Soil 122 concentrations of major plant nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were significantly greater closer to bird colonies. VOILHT Recovery from damage. Observation of sites which had vegetation removed ten years ago indicated that detectable moss growth can occur over a nine year period. This is the first demonstration of growth at these latitudes. The growth rate, however is very slow and patchy being greatly influenced by shelter. These results suggest that several decades would be required to obtain a general prowth rate for the flush. Some indications have been obtained on the general dynamics of the flush and flush mosses. The central, upper flush, dominated by B. argenteum and Nostoc appears to be very active as shown by the recovery from footpath damage, This activity is also supported by the ‘rediscovery’ rate of other damage sites. The sites close to the central, wet part of flush @Vostec} show low recoveries, while one of the B. argenigum sites, near the flush centre showed zero recovery. The large sample sites suggest that the individual plant species also differ in their resistance to damage and ability to recolonize. P. heimii and 8. argenteum differ markedly in their morphological response to overwinter freeze drying. &. argenteum sheets appear to have no firm contact to the substrate and can curl up extensively at the edges. In contrast P.Aeimii hummocks remain an integral part of the substrate, and show little or no lifting. Itis no surprise then to discover that after damage, P. heimii can regrow from shoots 123 immersed deeply in the underlying substrate. B.argenteum, however shows no ability to do this and relies it seems, on waterborne, deciduous shoot tips to enter new areas. Wind and water dispersal! of vegetative fragments are probably the most important factors for plants on the Canada Glacier bryophyte flushes. These processes, together with faster water flow, would amply explain the more ‘active’ nature of some areas of the flush. Itis noted however, that part of the reason the flush exists ig due to the sheltered aspect which in turn reduces wind dispersal. As sporophyte production is sporadic in polar regions most bryophytes rely exclusively on asexual reproduction. Longton (1988) suggests the majority of bryophytes in the more severe polar regions produce neither spores or specialised asexual propagules. These plants are more likely to be dependent on gametophyte branching, fragmentation and regeneration for local dispersal and establishment, development and maintenance of colonies. P. heimit recovers — by regrowth from deep shoots. The evidence suggests that growth is Hmited by exposure at the sand surface and that shelter is needed for any rapid growth. The overall growth rate of P, heimii may even be Hmited by the rate of arrival of fine sediment by wind or water. Evidence has been presented as to the unpredictability of water flow from season to season in the Dry Valley area, which may affect propagule dispersal or the photosynthetic activity of the plants during the summer months. Even if the plants do manage to disperse to damaged areas there is likely to be an 124 extensive period of time before these areas recover completely due to the low productive rates of these plants. As decomposition is slow in these communities a relatively high phytomass does not necessarily imply comparable levels of production and 100 g m-? has been proposed as a realistic annual production for B. argenteum. turfs on Ross Island (Longton 1974). In contrast Ino (1983) predicted mean annual production for B. argenteum turfs of only 4 g m-? in B, pseudotriquetrum turfs near Syowa Station with negative values as low as -16 g¢ m?* durmg years when meterological data suggested that respiration exceeded gross photosynthesis. Production rates of epilithic biomass in Dry Valley streams may be very low. Howard-Williams and Vincent (1986), report that in many cases the biomass observed in mid summer is of the same order of magnitude, or less than that of the over wintering stock. The production values presented for Antarctic bryophytes are comparable to figures presented for arctic zones, Wiepolaski (1975) states that generally annual primary production increases from polar to temperate regions but the variation between plant communities in each zone is great. Bryophyte production of greater than 200 ¢ m-*/year have been noted for hummocky sites in the southern arctic tundra at Devon Island in Canada (Pakarinen and Vitt 1973) and an annual bryophyte production of 250-1000 ¢ m-? is reported from the sub and maritime Antarctic (Clark et al.197 1, Collins 1973). The relatively low production rates mean that the ability of these bryophytes to recover from damage is not high and depends to a great extent on the variation in chmatic factors from year to year. 125 Kalho and Kdrenlampi (1975) note that in the evaluation of growth rates of mosses and lichens in high latitude and high altitude ecosystems one should consider the rate of functioning of the ecosystem in which they play the role of primary producers. A higher growth rate would necessitate a higher decomposition rate or consumption rate (where applicable). So although rates of photosynthesis and reproduction are low by temperate standards they are in good balance with other rates of functioning of their ecosystems. VIIEIV Invertebrates Despite the harshness of conditions in the Dry Valleys the invertebrates listed from the Canada Glacier lower flush represent most major groups recorded as being present on continental Antarctica (Laws 1984). Notable for their absence are collembolans which have been collected from the north facing slopes of the Taylor Valley. The absence of collembolans at the Canada Glacier flush was also noted by Greenfield and Wilson (1981), The two sites where collembolans are noted in this report (Southern face, Taylor Valley and Granite Harbour) are both north facing areas which as a result, receive a greater average amount of solar radiation per annum, This may be sufficient to create a more favourable microclimate for cllembolans over a longer part of the summer than on the eastern side of the Canada Glacier. While Platyhelminthes are noted at the Canada Glacier they were not included in Laws’ (1984) compilation of terrestrial invertebrates, although turbeliarians were mentioned as making up part of the aquatic invertebrate fauna of Moss Lake, Signy Island. Dougherty and Harris (1963) emphasized i26 that while nearly all samples of wet aigal felt they examined contamed populations of rotifers, nematodes and tardigrades, the occurrence of microturbellarians was inconsistent. . Mites were collected from the Lake Fryxeli area in 1972 (Strandtmann et al.1973), in 1980/81 (Greenfield and Wilson 1981) and in 1984/85 (Block 1985). The first collection site was adjacent to the Canada Glacier on the Lake Fryxell side. Strandtmann (pers. comm.) has found mites to be present in some areas but to be completely absent at others that appeared identical and a similar phenomenon was observed in the present study. More detailed | examination of mites would give more of an insight into their distribution in this area. The invertebrate species list obtained for the Granite Harbour region differs from that for the Fryxell area in that there were no turbellarians recorded (although the cursory nature of investigation here would not have picked them up if they were present). However abundant collembolans were seen and these msects appeared to be grazing the surface of the mosses. Broady (1979a), in a study of collembolans on Signy Island found no evidence that they feed on living bryophyte tissue but that there was a preference for dead and decaying bryophyte material. Both pre-melt and post-melt rotifer densities calculated for the Fryxell flush are comparable with densities published for the maritime Antarctic (Table 8.2). Nematode and tardigrade densities calculated are within the range of values presented in Table 8.2. 127 My results show a tendency for animals to inhabit the upper zones of the mosses once free water is available on the flush. Jennings (1979) found that 70% of tardigrades occurred in the upper 3cm of mosses on Signy Island. Caldwell (1981) showed the majority of nematodes in the upper lem of moss. Broady (1979b) notes the presence of most algae in a restricted region of 0 6mm down the bryophyte shoots on Signy Island and studies indicate that the surface 1-1.5 cm of the moss turf is the zone where virtually all of the primary production of mosses and algae occurs (Usher and Booth 1984), Broady (1978a) suggests that Habrotrocha sp. and tardigrades may graze on this algae. 128 Table 8.2: Published records of invertebrate abundance.

Cyclical temporary water bodies, then, select for species which are adapted te these conditions. Survival of an organism, under these conditions, depends on effective emigration and immigration abilities or on exceptional physiological tolerance (Williams 1987). Antarctic species due to their peneral isolation and the presence of uniformly harsh conditions tend to rely on the latter. Many lifecycle ‘strategies’ have developed among the inhabitants of ephemeral waterbodies to enable them to exploit the resources of these environments. Experiments on the cooling of desiccated tardigrades, rotifers and nematodes have led to the definition of ’anabiosis’ (suspension of life) in these groups (Block 1982), This anabiosis can manifest itself as different survival ‘strategies’ between invertebrate proups. 129 Williams(1987) sts some of these strategies. Rotifers survive as dehydrated individuals and some bdelloids secrete protective cysts. The most abundant rotifers in the bryophyte flushes are bdelloids. Rotifers which inhabit mosses must necessarily be forms that can survive drying, and for the most part be creeping species owing to the lack of room for swimming. Bdelioids have the ability to pass into a state of anabiosis when dried and to remain in this condition for years. During this latent life they can stand extremes of temperature even lower than -200 degrees celsius. Upon being moistened again they resume activity and are directly ready to deposit eggs. Habrotrocha sp. secrete shells which defend them against too rapid drying (Donner 1966). The parthogenetic reproduction of bdelloid rotifers enables a rapid increase in population. Rotifer activity begins very early in the season as soon as free water is availabie (Everitt 1981). While no quantitative records were kept of the difference in number between bdelloids and monogonont rotifers during the 1989 study, it was noted that the monogononts were more prevalent in samples taken later in the season. Everitt (1981) suggests they complete their life cycle during summer with the resistant resting egg (the product of the sexual phase) as the overwintering stage. Nematodes survive the winter as eggs, larvae or cysts (Williams 1987). All of the three wetter zones at the Fryxell flush had significantly higher numbers of nematodes than the drier zones in pre-melt counts. The same pattern can be seen in post-melt counts. Previous studies at Signy Island indicated that nematodes were more numerous in wetter mosses (Tilbrook 130 1967), however Spaull (1973) showed that while this is true there is no direct correlation between water content of mosses and total numbers of nematodes. My results would indicate a similar conclusion. There was very little increase in tardigrade numbers between the premelt and post-melt samples during this study. This may be explained by tardigrade life history tactics leading to a relatively slow development rate. In order to survive desiceation and freezing tardigrades incorporate a resistant ‘tun’ stage in their life cycle. When tardigrades enter this stage (reducing their surface area by assuming a short barrel shape) they are able to withstand a . wide range of physical.and chemical stress (Barnes 1968). Everitt (1981) indicates there is a rise in total numbers of Hypsibius (which has a high fecundity) during the summer in an algal mat in Deep Lake Tarn. Other tardigrade species may only have 2-6 eggs/ female compared to the 30 of HAypsibius and Everitt (1981) notes it took from N ovember to February for tardigrades to reach full size. Macrobiotus sp. was studied at Mossel Lake (Pickard 1986). There was no sudden increase in Ist instars at any time and there was no summer peak m density as new generations emerged. In the Mossel Lake area, it seems that all instars and the egg stage develop when free water is available and stop when the moss dries out. Experimental results indicated that Macrobiotus normally require at least two years to develop and possibly live for several years as an adult (Pickard 1986), The life histories of nematodes and tardigrades mean that numbers do not increase dramatically early in the summer season. Kotifers with rapid parthogenetic reproduction have the capacity for rapid population increase as 131i soon as free water arrives on the flush. Mites may persist as larvae over winter continuing their hfe.cycle with the onset of favourable conditions (Williams 1987). _ VILVY Conclusions My study has outlined the extent of two major areas of bryophyte growth. in the Taylor Valley. A description ofthese communities with regard to cover estimates, species distribution and associations has been outhned. Comment has been made on the importance of environmental conditions in determining these factors. The invertebrate groups inhabiting the plants have been enumerated and initial observations of their correlation with plants on the flushes made. The area of bryophytes at $.S.8.1 No. 12 are an important community in that they have attained relatively high biomass figures in a particularly harsh environment, and they provide niches for representatives of most invertebrate groups found on the continent. This area also provides us with an accessible site where if is possible to monitor rates of recovery from damage. The general fragility of the plant communities forming flush vegetation in the Dry Valleys is confirmed. Although recovery processes do occur it is clear that many decades, or even centuries, will be needed to finally repair the existing damage. It is interesting to note the significant differences in fauna and especially the flora between the Taylor Valley and Granite Harbour sites. The Granite Harbour site provides a useful comparison of the effect of microclimate on these 132 polar communities, and is an example of the increased diversity that can be achieved given a slightly less harsh environment. It is by increasing, and accurately evaluating our knowledge of the dynamics of these ecosystems, that we can implement management strategies which are suited to the environment, and the likely pressures which will be imposed upon it in the future.

ABSTRACT Abundant immature sporophytes of the moss Pottia heimii are reported from the Lower Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys and from Cape Chocolate, both near Ross Island. These finds extend the reported southern limit for the occurrence of abundant moss sporophytes to 77°5$’s.. KEYWORDS Bryophyte, Moss, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Sporophytes. 134 INTRODUCTION Mosses tepresent a significant component of the terrestrial flora in continental Antarctica. Plants have been reported as far south as 84°42°S (Wise & Gressitt 1965) but there is a sharp decline in species number from around 90 species in the maritime Antarctic, about 12 species at 68°S (main Antarctic coastline) to 4 species in the MeMurdo Dry Valley (Seppelt 1984). There is a similar decline, with increasing latitude, in the reported occurrence of fruiting mosses. Capsules can be commonly found in the Antarctic Peninsula, although reported in less than 25% of the moss species (Longton 1988} but are much rarer in conunental Antarctica. Seppelt (1984) gave only three records from the latter region: Bryum algens (= B, pscudotriquetrum) from Fold Island (Filson & Willis 1975); Pottia heimii from Syowa Station (Nakanishi, 1977; Kanda 1981); and Grimmia irichophylia from the Bunger Hills (Australasian Antarctic Expedition 1912). Young, immature sporophytes of B. antarcticum (now reidentified as P. Aehnii) had previously been reported once at both Cape Bernacchi (77°28.9'S) and Marble Point (77°25.8'S) {Greene ef al. 1967). More recently there have been reports of fruiting in Pottia austro georgia, Bryum pseudotriguetrum and Bryum ambiyodon from Syowa Station (Kanda 1981); Brym pseudatiriguetrum from the Stillwell Hills, near Fold Island, and Vestfold Hills (Seppelt, unpublished data). 135 Only two of the records come from areas south of the main Antarctic coastline at around 68°S, This paucity may well result from an increase in environmental severity (lower mean summer temperatures, lower free water availability and shorter growing season) with increase in latitude. It must also reflect a lack of suitable growth sites, the North Victoria Land coastline representing one of the few, almost continuous ice-free areas that reach farther south from 68°S. We report here the finding of numerous Pottia heimii sporophytes at two locations in the McMurdo Dry Valleys near Ross Island (Fig. 1). Cape Chocolate/Hobbs Glacier This location, visiied briefiy in December 1976 by a Victoria University expedition, was on the coast between Cape Chocolate and the delta of the Hobb’s Glacier melt stream; 77°55’S, 164°32’E, The fertile mosses, all Pottia heimil, showed relatively luxuriant growth in loose gravel wetted by melt water from Hobb’s Glacier. Sporophytes were found at several sites and capsule expansion was noted in some cases with setae up to 8-10 mm in length. No microclimate data are available for the Cape Chocolate/Hobb’s Glacier area but it can be expected to be milder than most of the Dry Valleys. The site is coastal but sea ice is present almost continuously in most years so that maritime influences are not strong. The aspect is predominantly southerly and there is considerable protection from the strong westerly winds by mountains up to 1600 m high. A west to east ridge above 600 m high lies to the north and provides protection from cold air flow down Blue Glacier. These features could be expected to provide a much milder microclimate than at Marble Point and Cape Bernacchi, about 50 km further north. 136 Canada Glacier flush The flush lies at 77°37°S, 163°33’E in the Lower Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys and occupies a small area of about 0.5 hectare adjacent to the eastern edge of the Canada Glacier. Moss growth appears to have been encouraged by local microclimate at the flush site. The presence of the adjacent 30m ice face of the Canada Glacier to the west protects the flush from both the easterly and westerly winds (up and down the Taylor Valley respectively). The mosses are therefore not subjected to abrasion by wind-borne dust nor are they blown away in their freeze-dried condition over the winter. The glacier also provides a regular water supply, in December and January, which flows across a gentle slope with little risk of scouring. The flush is believed, from field surveys made in the region, to be the largest, high-density area of moss in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Over the 1989/90 Austral sammer detailed mapping of the flush was carried out to determine the interactions between the two dominant mosses, Bryum argentewmn and P. heimii, and the rarer B. pseudotriquetrum. A general plan of the flush 1s shown in Fig. 2A. There is arelatrvely simple pattern of a central, predominantly cyanobacterial zone, dominated by a Nostec sp. (Broady 1982) along the lines of main water flow, then a B, argenteum zone and an outer P. heimii zone (Fig. 2B). Overall, 8. argenteum occupies wetter sites and is not found in the drier margins where only sal encrusted P. heimii occurs. Immature sporophytes of P. heimii were initially found on the upper, western part of the flush, but, after an exhaustive search, a total of 40 sites were confirmed. (Fig. 2A). At each site one to several (but less than ten) many sporophytes id were found, generally 3 to 6mm in length and were of normal, healthy colour except for occasional white, dead specimens. The capsules had not expanded. Detailed mapping was carried out ta further define the locations in which sporophytes occurred, Two typical microtopographic profiles are given in Figs. 3A and 3B. These demonstrate that throughout the flush sporophytes occurred only in well protected, ephemerally wet but not saturated, locations. Shelter was the dominant factor since _many large areas of P. heimii receive adequate water but sporophytes occurred only adjacent to rocks or in holiows. A warmer, more bumid environment would be expected at these locations because of the lower wind speed. DISCUSSION These discoveries have extended the southernmost records of sporophyte occurrence to 77°37’S and 77°55°S. The latter is the most southerly fruiting location reported for a moss, The microtopographic studies strongly support the belief that harsh environmental conditions, low temperatures, wind, minimal free water availability, and the short growing season limit sporophyte production. A careful search of protected microsites of the type described here in moss areas along the Ross Sea coast will probably yield additional records of fruiting mosses, particularly of P. heimii.
