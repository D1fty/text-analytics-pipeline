Location Southern Victoria Land, Ross Dependency, Antarctica. Methods Samples were collected from locations in the vicinity of the Mackay Glacier. We analysed mitochondrial DNA (COI) sequence variability for 97 individuals representing three species (Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni n=67; Cryptopygus nivicolus, n=20; Antarcticinella monoculata, n=8). Haplotype diversity and genetic divergences were calculated and used to indicate population variability as well as infer divergence times of isolated populations using molecular clock estimates. Results Two of the three species showed high levels of genetic divergence. Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni, a widespread and common species showed 7.6% sequence divergence on opposite sides of the Mackay Glacier. The more range restricted Cryptopygus nivicolus species showed 4.0% divergence among populations. The third species, Antarcticinella monoculata, was found in only one location. Molecular clock estimates based on sequence divergences suggest that populations separated within the last 4 Mya. Main Conclusions Habitat fragmentation resulting from Pliocene (5 Mya) and Pleistocene (2 Mya - 10 Kya) glaciations has promoted and maintained high levels of diversity among isolated springtail populations on relatively small spatial scales. The region surrounding the Mackay Glacier has provided refugia for springtail populations during glacial maxima and remains an area of high genetic and species diversity for Collembola within the Ross Sea region. 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 Key Words Collembola, glaciation, Ross Sea region, population genetics, springtails, refugia. 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 Introduction With only 0.34% (46,200 km?) of the total 14 million km? ice free and even marginally habitable, the Antarctic continent represents one of the most extreme environments for terrestrial life (Convey et al., 2009; Hogg & Wall, 2012). The majority of these ice-free areas lie within the Dry Valleys and Transantarctic Mountains of the Ross Dependency (Janetschek, 1967a; Levy, 2012). Even here, exposed ground is often highly fragmented and comprised of small, rocky outcrops separated by permanent snow fields and glaciers. Suitable habitat is then further restricted by the availability of liquid water necessary to support life (Hogg et al., 2006). This latter requirement is relevant for the soil arthropod fauna, particularly the Antarctic springtails which lack a desiccation-resistant life stage and instead use avoidance and super-cooling methods to allow survival in sub-zero temperatures (McGaughran et al., 201 1a). The terrestrial arthropods are represented primarily by springtails (Collembola) and mites (Acari) and are the largest year-round taxa on the continent (Gressitt, 1967; Hogg & Stevens, 2002; Adams et al., 2006). These taxa, which lack survival and dispersal strategies possessed by other invertebrate groups such as nematodes (Adhikari et al.,2010; Nkem et al., 2006), have been restricted to these fragmented, ice-free zones since the Middle Miocene (14-11 Mya; Stevens & Hogg, 2003; Stevens et al., 2006; McGaughran et al., 2010). At this time, glaciation of the whole continent reached its fullest extent and the polar ice cap overflowed the Transantarctic Mountains (Lewis et al., 2007) . Small oases of ice-free ground existed around the edge of the polar cap, the largest of which (the Dry Valleys) is still located within the Transantarctic Mountain on the western edge of the Ross Ice Shelf (Clapperton & Sugden, 1990). Since then, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) has undergone numerous glacial cycles, with the last glacial maximum ending 17 Kya (Suggate, 1990). This extensive 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 glacial history has resulted in extremely low species richness for the Antarctic fauna, with many habitats containing at most one or two arthropod taxa (Janetschek, 1967a). Species are also rarely shared between regions (Gressitt, 1967; Wise, 1971; Sinclair & Stevens, 2006), suggesting limited inter-habitat dispersal. Consequently, the current arthropod taxa are likely to be long-term inhabitants and remnants of, once more widespread species (Convey et al., 2009). Even within regions, most species show high levels of genetic divergence across their distributional ranges suggesting the effects of long-term isolation and/or survival in glacial refugia (Frati et al., 2001; Stevens & Hogg, 2003; McGaughran et al., 2008; Hawes et al., 2010; Stevens & D'Haese, 2014). Here, our aim was to extend these studies by focussing on small-scale differences that might occur within faunally-diverse, yet heavily fragmented, landscapes. Ten species of springtail are currently known from the Ross Dependency, four in northern Victoria Land, three in southern Victoria Land and three in the southern Transantarctic Mountains. All species are range-restricted. Species from southern Victoria Land, the focus of our study, consist of three species covering a 3° latitudinal range. Within this region Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni is the only relatively widespread species and is common throughout southern Victoria Land (McGaughran et al., 2011b). Two additional species, Cryptopygus nivicolus (recently redescribed from Neocryptopygus nivicous by Greenslade, (2015)) and Antarcticinella monoculata are extremely range-restricted and known only from one or two locations near the Mackay Glacier to the north of the Dry Valleys (Wise, 1971) (Fig. 1), suggesting the possibility of a glacial refugium. Recent studies of lichens and mosses also near the Mackay Glacier (Green et al., 2011), as well as haplotype diversity for springtail (G. hodgsoni) and mite (Stereotydeus. mollis) taxa have further suggested this area as a likely refugial zone (Stevens & Hogg, 2003, 2006; McGaughran et al., 2008; Demetras et al., 2010). 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 In order to determine the geographic scales on which genetic diversity may have been promoted and/or maintained, we focused on small-scale genetic variability in a region of comparatively high species diversity (Mackay Glacier, southern Victoria Land). This glacier is one of only a few outlet glaciers that connect the EAIS with the Ross Ice Shelf in southern Victoria Land (Clapperton & Sugden, 1990). Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that this region would support genetically divergent springtail populations among isolated habitats. We predicted that high levels of both genetic variability and genetic divergence would exist among these habitats, potentially indicating refugial zones from the Pleistocene glaciations. Methods Study sites and sample collection: Samples were collected from St John's Ranges near Victoria Valley and on the northern and southern sides of the Mackay Glacier in the northern Dry Valleys region of the Ross Dependency (Fig. 1). Specimens were collected from the undersides of rocks using modified aspirators (Stevens & Hogg, 2002). Soil samples were also taken from each site and returned to the lab where they were suspended a 10% sucrose solution. Invertebrates were then removed from the solution surface under a dissecting microscope (10X magnification) using a fine wire loop. All specimens were stored in 95% ethanol and returned to the University of Waikato for further processing. All specimens were morphologically identified to species level using Gressitt et al., (1963) and Salmon, (1965). Specimens not used for DNA analyses were archived at the School of Science, University of Waikato, under the care of IDH. Genetic analyses: Genetic analyses were jointly carried out at the University of Waikato and at the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding (CCDB) at the University of Guelph. At the University of 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 14] 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 Waikato total genomic DNA was extracted from the tissue of entire specimens using a Glassfiber Plate DNA Extraction (AcroPrep) method (Ivanova et al., 2006) at CCDB, and Red Extract n Amp (Sigma-Aldrich) using 10 ul extraction solution and 2.5 ul tissue prep, following manufacture’s protocol. Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCRs) were comprised of a 15 ul reaction containing 5.7 ul MQH20, 7.5 ul PCR Master Mix Solution G-Taq, Intron Biotechnology), 0.4 ul of each primer and 1 ul of template DNA. A 658 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene was amplified using the primers HCO2198 (sequence 5' TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3') and an altered LCO1490 (sequence: 5’AGTTCTAATCATTAARGATATYGG-3') (Folmer et al., 1994) for the G. hodgsoni specimens. HCO and LepF1 (sequence: 5'-ATTCAACCAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3') (Hajibabaei et al., 2006) were used to amplify the C. nivicolus and A. monoculata specimens. The standard LCO1490 (sequence: 5'-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3') was used for both species (in place of the altered LCO1490 and LepF1) at CCDB. Primers were used at 1.0 mM concentration. PCR conditions at CCDB were: initial denaturing at 94°C for 1 min; 5 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 45°C for 1.5 min and 72°C for 1.5 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 1.5 min and 72°C for 1 min followed by a final 72°C for 5 min. PCR conditions were: initial denaturing at 94°C for 5 minutes; 36 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 1.5 min and 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were cleaned using Sephadex (CCDB) or 0.2 ul Exonucleasel (EXO) and 0.1 ul Shrimp Alkaline Phosphate (SAP) with 2.7 ul MQH20 following manufactures protocol (Global Science & Tech Ltd.) at Waikato. DNA was sequenced in both directions on an ABI3130 sequencer at the University of Waikato DNA sequencing facility using the same primers used for amplification, or on an ABI3730x1 at CCDB. Sequences from the University of Waikato were aligned using Geneious, ver 5.4.2, and confirmed as the target species using the Barcode of Life DataSystems (BOLD; www.boldsystems.org) ver 3 COI 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 animal identification searches. Previous analyses of Antarctic springtails (e.g. Stevens & Hogg 2003), have shown that allozyme analyses were congruent with COI data and that the latter can be used as a reliable indicator of genomic differences occurring among populations. Primer sequences were trimmed from sequence fragments for further analyses. All sequences were uploaded to the BOLD project Antarctic Terrestrial Arthropods (ANTSP) and cross referenced to GenBank. Phylogenetic Analysis COI sequence fragments of 658 bp (219 codons) were obtained for 67 G. hodgsoni specimens and 20 C. nivicolus specimens. Approximately 560 bp were obtained from single direction reads (using primer LepF1) for eight A. monoculata specimens. No stop codons were detected. Sequences of G. hodgsoni were unambiguous at 658 bp (no insertions or deletions). However, sequences of C. nivicolus and A. monoculata contained ambiguous base pair assignments which could not be easily resolved, so sequences were further trimmed at both ends, resulting in sequence fragments of 547 bp (181 codons) for C. nivicolus and 527 bp (175 codons) for A. monoculata. Two additional C. nivicolus sequences were also obtained from GenBank (Accession numbers DQ285403 and DQ285404). Sequences for all species were initially examined in the context of generating a single neighbour-joining tree using a Kimura 2-parameter distance model (Kimura, 1980). All duplicate sequences were identified and removed to include only unique haplotypes in subsequent analyses. Due to the lack of publically available sequence data for taxa that share a recent common ancestor with our ingroup taxa (and that did not approach saturation), analyses were run unrooted among the ingroup taxa. No significant changes were noted in topography between these analyses and ones run previously using Podura aquatic as a test. Chi-square tests (X7) as implemented in PAUP* 4.0 (Swofford, 2002) were used to determine 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 19] 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 whether the assumption of equal base frequencies among sites was violated on all sites and on third codon positions only. JModel test 2.1.2 (Posada, 2008) was used to determine the most appropriate substitution model for Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis. Settings were as follows: 11 substitution schemes (88 models), base frequencies +F, rate variation +I, +I, set to BioNJ. The model selected for the data set was GTR + I +I (-InL = 1,590.9). Maximum Likelihood heuristic searches were conducted using this model in MEGA 5.10 (Tamura et al., 2011) using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Maximum Parsimony (MP) analyses were performed in PAUP* using 1000 full-heuristic search bootstrap replicates. MrBayes 3.2.6 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist, 2001) was used to conduct a Bayesian Inference analysis. A general time reversal model (GTR +I +I’) was used, with a log normal relaxed clock model and speciation Yule process as the tree prior. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was set to 1,100,000 generations, sampling trees every 200. A burn in of 100,000 trees was determined by plotting log-likelihood values against generation time in TRACER (Rambaut & Drummond, 2007) and checking for the point at which normalization occurred. The majority rule tree was acquired from the 11,004 trees sampled after the burn in period. The tree was then visualized in Tree Annotator (Drummond et al., 2012). Sequences for G. hodgsoni and C. nivicolus were split into separate data sets for analysis in the program TCS 1.21 (Clement et al., 2000) and to construct networks of sequence haploytpes. Single representatives of each haplotype were used in the final analysis to simplify files, and sequences of C. nivicolus were trimmed at 547 bp to avoid anomalies, as described above. The A. monoculata sequences were not included in these analyses as they were only collected from a single site and consisted of only two similar haplotypes (<0.2% divergence). 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 Uncorrected pair-wise genetic distances between COI sequences for populations at different locations were also calculated for the G. hodgsoni and C. nivicolus data sets in MEGA 5.10. The likelihood ratio test did not detect evidence of significant rate heterogeneity for G. hodgsoni. (X’=113.06; p<0.001; d.f=14) or C. nivicolus (X’=141.15; p<0.001; d.f=10). Approximate geological timing of isolation for the populations was estimated through molecular clock analyses in BEAST 1.8.2 (Drummond et al., 2012). Files generated in BEAUti used a General Time Reversal model (GTR + I +I) with speciation Yule Processes as the tree prior and the same MCMC set up as used for the BI tree analysis. A strict clock model with a fixed rate of 0.0115 was used to simulate 2.3% sequence divergence per million years, as determined using insect mitochondrial data (Brower 1994; Juan et al., 1996; Quek et al., 2004; McGaughran et al., 2010). Despite being calibrated for insects, the 2.3% sequence divergence per million years was considered a suitable estimate for Collembola as both taxa have similar life cycles (McGaughran et al., 2010). Results Of the 658 bp analysed for G. hodgsoni, 515 characters were constant, 22 were parsimony informative and the remaining 121 were parsimony uninformative. The nucleotide composition averaged across all sequences showed an A-T bias of 64.0% (A = 27.7%, T = 36.7%, C = 19.3%, G = 16.7%). Nucleotide frequencies were not significantly different among sequences for all codon positions (X° = 2.19, p = 1.0, d.f = 48) or for third codon positions only (xX? = 7.18, p = 1.0, d.f = 48). Of the 549 bp analysed for C. nivicolus, 433 characters were constant, 22 were parsimony informative and the remaining 94 were parsimony uninformative. The nucleotide composition averaged across all sequences showed an A-T bias of 61.4% (A = 25.8%, T = 35.6%, C = 20.4%, G = 18.2%). Base pair frequencies for C. nivicolus were not significantly different among sequences for all codon positions (X’ 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 = 1.41, p = 1.0, d.f = 36) or for third codon positions only (X° = 5.77, p =1.0, d.f = 36). Of the 527 bp (175 codons) analysed for A. monoculata, 408 characters were constant, 1 was parsimony informative and the remaining 118 were parsimony uninformative. The nucleotide composition averaged across all sequences showed an A-T bias of 59.0% (A = 23.9%, T = 35.1%, C = 22.3%, G = 18.7%). Base pairs were not significantly different among sequences for all codon positions (X* = 3.39, p = 1.0, d.f = 21) or for third codon positions only (X’ = 11.55, p = 0.95, d.f = 21). Phylogenetic Analysis A Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree is shown in Fig. 2. Tree constructions for Maximum Parsimony (Fig.3) and Neighbour Joining (data not shown) showed similar topology and node support. Linking nodes between the haplotype G16 and the rest of the G. hodgsoni haplotypes had 100% bootstrap support in the ML and MP trees. The linking node between the C. nivicolus haplotypes at Springtail Point and at Mt Gran also received 100% bootstrap support in the ML and MP trees. Bootstrap values for the Mt England C. nivicolus haplotypes indicated high support from both the ML and MP trees. The topology for the G. hodgsoni haplotypes differed in the ML from both the MP and BI trees. Two clusters were apparent, with 0.99 bootstrap support for the node. Collection locations of haplotypes were mixed between both clusters. The topology of the BI tree was also similar to all other trees for G. hodgsoni, C. nivicolus and A. monoculata. Posterior probability values between C. nivicolus haplotypes at Springtail Point and at Mt Gran was 1.00, and also 1.00 between the Mt England and Mt Gran group (Fig. 4). The topology and node support of these trees supports the presence of high genetic structuring across the Mackay Glacier. Haplotype networks 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 The geographic distribution of sequence haplotypes for G. hodgsoni and C. nivicolus was investigated using haplotype joining networks. Subsequent haplotype assignments and their collection locations are shown in Table 1. Sixteen haplotypes were found from 67 G. hodgsoni sequences. Maximum connection steps were fixed at 40 in order to connect haplotype G16 to the rest of the haplotypes (Fig. 5). This network revealed 10 1-step haplotypes, three 2-step haplotypes, two 3-step haplotypes and one 35-step haplotype. The most divergent haplotype shown by this analysis was G16, representing three individuals from Mt Gran. This difference was also supported by divergence values and phylogenetic trees (Figs 2, 3, 4, 7). The remainder of the network which included haplotypes from the St John's Range and Mt Seuss did not show high geographic structure, similar to that observed in the tree-based approaches. Twelve haplotypes were found from 22 C. nivicolus sequences. Maximum connection steps were fixed at 30 in order to connect the Mt Gran and Mt England haplotypes to the Springtail point haplotypes (Fig. 6). This network revealed nine l-step haplotypes, two 3-step haplotypes and one 16-step haplotype. This network analysis showed two groups of haplotypes that were connected by 16 missing mutational steps. These two groups corresponded to populations at Springtail Point on the south edge of Mackay Glacier, and Mt Gran and Mt Seuss to the north and in the centre of the glacier respectively. This difference was supported by divergence values and phylogenetic trees. The 2-step link to haplotypes at Mt England was also supported by divergence values and phylogenetic trees. COI sequence divergence and molecular clock estimates Genetic distances ranged from 0.0-8% for G. hodgsoni and 0.00-4.2% for C. nivicolus (Fig.7). Greatest differences were found between haplotype G16 at Mt Gran and the remainder of the G. hodgsoni haplotypes, and the genetic distance between C. nivicolus 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 haplotypes at Mt Gran and Mt England, and those at Springtail Point. The St John's Range and Mt Seuss G. hodgsoni haplotypes showed an average divergence of 0.6% within the group (Fig.7). The single haplotype, G16, at Mt Gran showed an average of 7.6% sequence divergence from the other haplotypes. The average sequence divergences among C. nivicolus haplotypes within each location were 0.1% at Mt Gran, 0.2% at Springtail Point and 0.2% at Mt England. Sequence divergences between locations showed the haplotypes at Mt Gran to be an average of 4.0% divergent from haplotypes at Mt England. Similarly, Springtail Point haplotypes were an average of 3.8% divergent from those found at Mt Gran. The Mt Gran and Mt England haplotypes were the most similar, with 0.8% sequence divergence between them. Based on a strict molecular clock rate of 2.3% sequence divergence per million years, these populations are all likely to have diverged within the last 4 My (Figs 7, 8). The oldest estimated divergence dated the genetic separation of G. hodgsoni haplotypes at Mt Gran (G16) and those in the St John's Range and at Mt Seuss at 3.8 Mya. Divergence dates between the three C. nivicolus populations suggested that the Springtail Point haplotypes diverged from the Mt Gran - Mt Seuss population 1.44 Mya. The difference between haplotypes from Mt Gran and Mt Seuss relative to those at Mt England is much more recent by comparison, estimated at 0.38 Mya. Discussion Our mitochondrial DNA (COI) analysis of 97 Antarctic springtails from three taxonomic species revealed highly divergent populations across 65 km within the Mackay Glacier. Populations of Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni and Cryptopygus nivicolus on the lower slopes of Mt Gran were shown to be an average of 7.6% and 3.8% divergent from their nearest neighbours. For G. hodgsoni, this represents a considerably greater genetic divergence among 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 populations than the 2.4% divergence previously found for this species throughout the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Stevens & Hogg, 2003; Nolan et al., 2006; McGaughran et al., 2008). High genetic structure, within both putative species, suggests that populations may have survived in situ since the Antarctic continent became fully glaciated. Given the elevations of surrounding mountains it is possible that several locations such as Mt Gran (2235 m) and Mt Seuss (1190 m) protruded above the advancing Mackay Glacier, and remained so since the early Pliocene (Janetschek, 1967a; Clapperton & Sugden, 1990). In particular, this area is known to contain the highest species diversity of springtails in southern Victoria Land, with G. hodgsoni, C. nivicolus and A. monoculata all known from this area (Gressitt et al., 1963). The species diversity of mites, lichens and mosses have also been shown to be high in the Mackay Glacier region relative to other nearby areas such as the Dry Valleys (Demetras et al., 2010; Green et al., 2011). This suggests that this area has served as a glacial refuge for multiple taxa during the last 5 Mya. We now also highlight the potential for species-level genetic divergences within two springtail taxa for populations on opposite sides of the Mackay Glacier, which may indicate early stages of speciation. Our data suggest that the population of G. hodgsoni present on the lower slopes of Mt Gran has been isolated from other known G. hodgsoni populations since the Mid-Pliocene (4 Mya). Similarly, the population of C. nivicolus from the same location has been isolated from a neighbouring population at Springtail Point by as much as 1.4 Mya. The occurrence of A. monoculata at Springtail Point, coupled with the highly divergent populations at Mt Gran supports the notion of high arthropod diversity for this area. The differences in divergence estimates for G. hodgsoni (3.8 Mya) and C. nivicolus (1.4 Mya) may be the result of different evolutionary histories (e.g. later isolation) or possibly differences in mutation rates. For example, Stevens & Hogg (2006) suggested that differing 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 34] 342 343 344 345 346 mutation rates may exist between G. hodgsoni and the mite Stereotydeus mollis. However, little is known about the life history of C. nivicolus. The lack of ecological knowledge for C. nivicolus also makes it difficult to predict its dispersal abilities. Dispersal events in Antarctica are likely to be rare, and often accidental, making it difficult to attribute the presence of a species to ecological gradients (Janetschek, 1967b; Magalhaes et al., 2012). G. hodgsoni 1s known to survive floating on both sea and fresh water, and dispersal events through wind or accidental carriage by birds is also possible (Stevens & Hogg, 2002; Hawes, 2011; McGaughran et al., 201 1a, 2011b). As Mackay Glacier is an outlet glacier for the EAIS, it is unlikely to have undergone significant retreat during the interglacial periods of the Pleistocene as many of the alpine glaciers did (Clapperton & Sugden, 1990; Sugden et al., 1999). This appears to have isolated the Mt Gran population of G. hodgsoni from the populations on Mt Seuss in the centre of the glacier, and those in the St John's Range bordering Victoria Valley. It 1s possible that the presence of haplotypes from the St John's range in the Mt Seuss population relate to recent dispersal since the last glacial maximum. The sharing of C. nivicolus haplotypes between Mt Gran and Mt Seuss also indicates potentially recent dispersal from Mt Gran across the glacier. Hawes, (2011) suggested that potential dispersal mechanisms may work in concert, whereby individuals could be wind-blown onto glaciers and then moved by glacial surface streams. The stochastic nature of dispersal events in Antarctica may explain why G. hodgsoni has yet to disperse from the Mt Gran population. One species, A. monoculata, was found at only one location in our study area, although another isolated population is known from Mt Murray 150 km to the north (Gressitt et al., 1963). Similarly, haplotypes of C. nivicolus present at this site were not found elsewhere in our study area. Springtail Point is in an ‘up-glacier’ position, making dispersal through 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 temporary melt water to more sea-ward locations possible. However, there was no evidence of water courses being formed by temporary streams in this area, and visual assessment of snow banks that surround the site indicate they have changed little since a previous visit (Gressitt et al., 1963). Even with surface water, the dispersal mechanisms used by other springtail species such as wind and stream flow may be limited for A. monoculata. The loss of pigmentation, limited tolerance of UV light and presence deeper in the soil profile (Janetschek, 1967a) make it less likely that A. monoculata would experience accidental dispersal by water or wind movement. We conclude that the Mackay Glacier has provided a sufficient dispersal barrier to promote and maintain high levels of genetic divergence in two Antarctic springtail species endemic to southern Victoria Land. This isolation likely occurred around the early Pliocene (4 Mya), and has been maintained by on-going glaciations during the Pleistocene. The high genetic diversity, both at the population and species level, suggests that high altitude sites in this region have served as glacial refugia over the past 4 Mya. The isolation of these sites highlights the potential for high genetic diversity to be maintained on a small scale among the fragmented ice-free areas of Antarctica. Accordingly, we suggest that conservation efforts be directed toward maintaining and protecting the integrity of highly fragmented landscapes within the Transantarctic Mountains of the Ross Dependency. 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 Acknowledgements We thank M.
