WHARTON I.M. BROWN Department of Zoology, University of Otago, P.O. Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand Abstract Asurvey was undertaken of the nematode fauna associated with moss and algal growth from terrestrial sites on Ross Island and the Dry Valleys of the McMurdo Sound region, Antarctica. Six species, in decreasing order of abundance, were identified: Plectus frigophilus, Eudorylaimus antarcticus, Scottnema lindsayae, Plectus antarcticus, Panagrolaimus davidi,and Monhystera villosa. Maps are given showing the distribution of these species. Cultures of Panagrolaimus davidi, Plectus antarcticus, and Plectus frigophilus were establishedonnutrient agar plates, feeding on bacteria.

INTRODUCTION Few surveys have been conducted of the nematode fauna of the continental Antarctic. Timm (1971) detailed reports of nematodes to that date and described six species of nematodes from various sites in the McMurdo Sound region. These included two members of the Arabolaimida (Plectus antarcticus de Man 1904 and Plectus frigophilus Kirjanova 1958), two members of the Rhabditida (Scotitnema lindsayae Timm 1971 and Panagrolaimus davidi Timm 1971), one member of the Dorylaimida Received 26 January 1989; accepted 10 May 1989. (Eudorylaimus antarcticus Steiner 1916), and one member of the Monhysterida (Monhystera villosa Biitschli 1873). In addition, Plectus parientinus and three Mesodorylaimus spp. have been recorded from Alexander Island in the continental west Antarctic (Maslen 1979) and Yeates (1979) reported Plectus antarcticus, Plectus frigophilus, and a Helicotylenchus sp. from the Bunger Hills and Gaussberg on the Wilhelm II coast. The present survey was conducted during the austral summer of 1988/9 and was based at Scott Base, Ross Island. MATERIALS AND METHODS Moss and algal samples were collected from various sites around Ross Island and the Dry Valleys area of Antarctica. The samples were weighed (10-80 g) and nematodes and other microfauna were extracted by placing in a 175 cm? Baermann funnel for 12 h. This extraction period was chosen because of the limited time available for processing samples in Antarctica and because preliminary experiments had indicated that most nematodes had been recovered from the sample during this interval. The sample was further concentrated by centrifugation and the number of nematodes counted to determine the number of worms per gram of sample. Other microfauna (rotifers, tardigrades, and protozoa) in the sample were noted. The nematodes were identified using the key given by Maslen (1979) and the descriptions in Timm (1971). Culture of nematodes was attempted using nutrient agar (1% agar, 0.1% nutrient broth), cornmeal agar (0.1%) and “bio” agar (1% agar plus one drop of “Baby Bio” plant food). Growth of microorganisms contained in the samples provided food for the nematodes. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results of the survey are shown in Table 1. Sample no. 1 was from a small area of moss growth on the lower slopes of Crater Hill behind Scott Base. 468 Ross Istand    Fig. 1 Map of the McMurdo Sound area showing the distribution of S. lindsayae (A), Plectus antarcticus (@) and Plectus frigophilus (@). Open symbols indicate new site records, dotted lines indicate glacier snouts and the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf. Data from Timm (1971) and present work. Cape Bird samples were from algal growth associated with runoff from the northern penguin rookery (sample 2), an area of algal growth near the path leading to the Cape Bird hut (sample 3), soil from runoff from the northern penguin rookery with no obvious algal growth (sample4), and algae and moss from the Kibble Valley SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest: samples 5-8). Cape Royds samples were from the melt water around the edge of Pony Lake (sample 9) and from areas of moss growth in the valleys north of Pony Lake (samples 10-13). Samples from the Dry Valleys region were from algae growing in meltwater from the Barclay Glacier (samples 14-16), from areas of red or orange algal growth in the meltwater and around the edge of several small ponds in between Lake Vanda and Lake Bull (samples 17-20), from extensive areas of algal growth around the edge of Lake Canopus near Lake Vanda (samples 21 and 22), and from algal growth in Drift Stream near Lake Fryxell (samples 23-25). We also received samples from the Darwin Mountains region which were stored for several New Zealand Joumal of Zoology, 1989, Vol. 16    Ross Island Fig. 2 Map of the McMurdo Sound area showing the distribution of Panagrolaimus davidi (Mi), E. antarcticus (@) and M. villosa (&).

Six species of nematode were found, all of which had been previously recorded by Timm (1971). Where nematodes were abundant they were usually found in association with tardigrades, rotifers, and ciliate protozoa. Nematode numbers varied considerably, even in different samples from the same general area. In general, algal samples contained greater densities of nematodes than did moss samples. The results of this survey, together with those of Timm (1971), enable maps to be drawn showing the distribution of the different species of nematode in the McMurdo Sound region (Fig. 1, 2). Plectus frigophilus is the most widespread species (13 sites), followed by E. antarcticus (12 sites), S. lindsayae 9 sites), Plectus antarcticus (6 sites), Panagrolaimus davidi (4 sites), and M. villosa (2 sites). Most species have a widespread distribution in this area, with the exceptionof M. villosa, which has only beenrecorded from two sites in the Dry Valleys region, and Panagrolaimus davidi, which hasonly beenrecorded from coastal sites.

The restricted distribution of M. villosa in the McMurdo Sound region suggests that itis at its southern limit at these sites. E. antarcticus has also been recorded from the west Antarctic (Maslen 1979). The remaining species appear to be restricted to the continental east Antarctic. Cultures of Panagrolaimus davidi, Plectus antarcticus,and Plectus frigophilus wereestablished on nutrient agar plates, feeding on bacteria which grew from the samples.
