Streams flowed for between one and two months, Stream water temperatures (range =0—11 °C) varied over short (hr) time scales whilst discharges varied considerably between streams (range 0.001—15 m*s~‘) and over diel cycles. Solar radiation and air temperature were major determinants of stream discharge. Variability in discharge was reflected in variability in nutrient chemistry and sediment load. Nitrogen and phosphorus varied considerably between streams; the meltwaters early in summer contained 10—20 times higher levels of dissolved N and P than later in the season. Within stream nutrient levels were modified by dense algal growths and penguin rookeries. Epilithic algal communities were made up predominantly of cyanophyceae which formed mats and crusts. Longitudinal and horizontal variability of species in the communities in selected streams is described. Analyses of algal cover and biomass (chlorophyll a) show that substrate type and flow rates are of greater importance than nutrients in influencing algal abundance and biomass. In some streams biomass values of over 20 ug Ch. a cm~? were recorded, much of which remains viable but inactive over the antarctic winter. Contents 1.

More than 95 percent of the continent is covered by thick ice, with air temperatures rarely above freezing. Yet for a few weeks each summer small seeps, streams and rivers flow within various regions near the coast. Flowing waters are particularly abundant in the vicinity of McMurdo Sound (Fig. 1, ca. 77 °S 165 °E). More than one hundred streams flow from coastal icesheets to the sea, or inland from alpine and piedmont glaciers located in the “Dry Valleys’, a 10000 km2 area containing deep valleys largely free of snow and ice. All of the streams lie within catchments devoid of plants more advanced than mosses, and are exposed to extremes of cold (to —55 °C in winter) and aridity (annual precipitation less than 7 em in the Dry Valleys). Many of the streambeds are coated with thick epilithic mats and films. These are dominated by algae, with associated bacteria, fungi and microherbivores (protozoa, rotifers, nematodes, tardigrades) which must survive a highly erratic flow regime, wide variations in temperature and nutrient content, rapid freezing and thawing and a brief growing season. Allochthonous inputs to these waters from the sparse microbial communities in the catchment are probably small, although considerable material can enter from the source glacier (DOWNES ef al.in press). Unlike many tenyperate streamwaters (e.g. FisHeR and Likens 1973) the upstream origin of nutrients is a clearly defined source, and within-stream, rather than catchment processes dominate the subsequent transfer of mass and energy. Until recently these streams have been a neglected aspect of biological studies in Antarctica (PARKER 1981, VINCENT and VINCENT in press). A detailed sequence of hydrological measurements is available for the largest Antarctic flowing water, the Onyx River (Curnn 1974, Curnn 1981) and notes on hydrological changes in smaller streams are given in Heywoop (1977), Horun et al. (1977) and WEAND et al. (1977). xeochemical attributes of Dry Valley streams and their influence on the chemistry of inland lakes have been examined (Torn e al. 1971, Horun et al. 1977, CANFIELD and GREEN 1983, WEAND ef al. 1977). Published biological work has centered on the taxonomy of certain algal communities (BRoaADY 1981, 1982, Hirano 1979, 1983, Seapure ef al. 1979) and photosynthetic rates of two types of epilithic community are documented in VINCENT and Howarp-WILLIAMS (1986). Antarctic streams form unusual ecosystems but there have been no previous attempts to make a combined study of their communities and environmental properties. In the present study we examined the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of a diverse range of streams in southern Victoria Land in order to compare their basic ecosystem attributes with lotic systems elsewhere. Antarctic Stream Ecosystems 513 2. The Study Sites During the summers of 1983/84 and 1984/85 we sampled 24 streams in the McMurdo Sound area of southern Victoria Land (Fig. t).

It starts along the Mt Bird Ice Sheet (Fig. 2) and falls some 100-110 m ultimately discharging into the Ross Sea. The stream falls sharply down steep unstable moraines into a valley where it cuts through moraine and nutrient rich ornithogenic soils (SPErR and CowLineG 1984) created by a large (40000 nests) Adelie penguin rookery (Fig. 3). This stream, like others in the area which flow over steep unstable slopes, has a high suspended particle load giving it a grey appearance. 2.2. Adams Stream The stream, 2.7 km long, originates along the edges of the Adais glacier 350 m above sea level and discharges into Lake Miers (Fig. 2) in the Miers Valley. The stream divides about midway down its full reach with part flowing down an extensive algal rich wash area which connects with the Miers stream; the bulk (>70 /) continues over a gravel bed in a well defined 7 m wide channel to site A3 (Fig. 4). In the final 1 km the stream descends over a series of steps with stony riffles between, 515 Antarctie Stream Ecosystems ‘4X94 94] UL pauOtUeUT says ApNys UUM stwurveal}s Sursvrzuo0d aly Jo stwreiserp x[lJorg *Z aan ———— ——— 29U8]SIG ——_—— uy O S OL S| O¢ Sé Of Sf OF Th jueweaed ——= sJapjnog ool wooolk 008 009 OOF             Oz OV    Bes ssoy eureiow doo}   yYVOMUMOIG          09 epue, eye) youesg Aenea 002 os oe] $seq 11Ng poomueely JOIN ~EpUeA OOL | 100s tb = 00f OSI | eo; pag JO1DB1F WGA, 4eMO 7 4a SS eae e eee M MS a AN WVAHLS AHSNOOY ‘N YSAAIW XANO uO OOOoL 000¢ OOOf ug 000d oooP wooded OOOL 0              JO19815 swepy oo¢ WwaxAsg -- OOL -OMe T —oysem eUL e4e7 wie eps WEAIIS 81910 4919815 -- 002 -- 19019815 woly yndul oy YyYsSemM Ose yyceMuowwWos epeuey Lv 3 M $ N MN as WVSYdLS SWVOV WVAHLS VIVAVONVHM WVSYLS TIAXAYdd eas 3acoge ju61I0H —->» a— (Ul) JOAdj C.

Discharge at this time was 1.3 ms71, 518 C. HowagpD-WILLIAMS é al. to an alluvial fan on the edge of Lake Miers where site A4 was located. The strean bed on these steps is a firm pavement of pebbles and gravel, whilst the alluvial fan is comprised of loose gravel. The stream water remained clear throughout its length. 2.3. Whangamata Stream (unofficial name) This stream (5.6 km long) starts about 180m above the level of Lake Fryxell along the west side of the Commonwealth glacier. For the first 1 km of its length the gradient is steep with icefalls from the glacier which form small dams in places. The stream channel here runs along the foot of the glacier on old lacustrine sediments between large (<1m diam.) boulders. For the next 1 km downstream the gradient is reduced slightly to a point where the stream leaves the glacier foot, cuts through loose moraine and flows across a flat sandy alluvial fan (“the wash’’, Fig. 2). The gradient then increases slightly, and the final 800 m of stream leads over rocks and gravel. The stream water was characterised by a turbid appearance during peak flows each day. 2.4. Fryxell Stream The main stream (2 km long) starts along the east side of the Canada glacier some 200 m above the level of Lake Fryxell. The stream rapidly increases in size along the first km as numerous ice streams contribute from various portions of the glacier. This upper 1 km is steep and the stream flows over rocks and boulders. At site F1 (Fig. 2) the gradient decreases as the channel flows away from the glacier. Considerable algal growth was evident at this point. A smal] flow from a moss “‘flush”’ area and a large pond on the right bank join the stream some 500m below site F1. From here the stream forms a 500 m stretch of gravels and stones with a dense algal cover. A steep 200 m bouldery section follows (Fig. 2) and at its lower reaches on the edge of L. Fryxell the stream spreads out across a dense Nostoc community growing as thick mats on a sandy substrate. We measured discharges of 0.06 m%s~! (Table 1) and the stream water was always clear. 2.0. Onyx River This river, the largest in Antarctica can be conveniently divided into two sections, the Upper Onyx (4.8 km) and the Main Onyx (30 km). Upper Onyx: This starts at the junction of the Greenwood and Wright Valleys ca. 300 m above sea level and receives water from the Greenwood and Lower Wright Glaciers. Its flow along the foot of the Lower Wright Glacier increases steadily until it leaves the glacier face in an aijluvial sandy plain leading to Lake Brownworth, 277 m above sea level (Fig. 2). Ice falls from the 30 m high glacier face have resulted in dans along the river in which the only algal mats in this stretch were seen. Flows continue around the ice moat on the northern side of Lake Brownworth to the exit from the lake where the Main Onyx begins. Cainn (1981) estimated that 86 9/) of the Main Onyx flow originated from the Upper Onyx. Main Onyx: This section of the river falls 190 m over the 30 km reach from Lake Brownworth to Lake Vanda. In the upper 1.5 km stretch, the river flows over a stable stony bed (gradient 0.0037 m -m~1) with a series of shallow depressions rich in algal material. The river then increases in slope (gradient 0.0075 m - m~) with an unstable bed as it cuts through the Trilogy Moraine complex, and receives intermittent inputs from the Clark and Denton streams. In places, sparse algal communi- Antarctic Stream Ecosystems D019 ties could be seen on rocks on the submerged sides of the river. From 6—13 km below Lake Brownworth the river meanders forming braided channels through a series of alluvial fans (gradient 0.0020 m - m~—'). Little algal material was visible here, but. it occurred on the rocks where the stream breaches the large Loop Moraine at ca. 14km down (Fig. 2). From here to 4km upstream from Lake Vanda (gradient 0.0040 m - m7!) the river meanders through sandy braided channels (Site 02, Figures d, 6). At this point it enters a wide (800 m across) flat “boulder pavement” which contains abundant algal mats. The river channel in this region disappears into a network of small interconnecting flows between the flat boulders. Below this the slope steepens, and the flows coalesce into a few distinct channels which enter a large ponded area called Lake Buil. The final slope from Lake Bull to Lake Vanda is steep (gradient 0.0395m-m7!) and the streambed comprises large boulders, with crusts and films of algae. In addition to the four sites shown on Fig. 2 we also examined algal community structure at the seven sites described in SuHaw and HEALY (1980) which form a useful set of reference points down the stream. The complex river morphology on the Onyx is discussed by SHaw and HEALy (1980) and the hydrology by Cuunn (1974, 1981). Flows of up to 15 m3s~1 have been recorded but the flow is highly variable from year to year. 3. Methods 3.1, Stream discharges Discharge in the Onyx River was measured at Vanda weir by the New Zealand Ministry of Works and Development (see Curnn 1981). For other streams, discharges were estimated from stream velocities obtained with a pygmy current meter, or, in some reaches where this was not feasible, by using a neutrally buoyant float with appropriate corrections (JoHN 1978). In both cases measurements were made in straight reaches where we had previously obtained cross-sectional! areas. 3.2. Water and ice samples Water samples were collected in acid-washed polythene bottles, and ice samples in polythene beakers. The latter were melted upon return to the field camps by placing the beakers in trays of warm water. All samples were filtered within a few hours of collection (Whatman GF/C filter paper). They were kept frozen during storage and the subsequent transport to the laboratory in New Zealand. All water analyses were carried out on a Technicon If auto-analyser system. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) was measured by the method of Downzs (1978a). Tota! dissolved phosphorus (TDP) was measured as DRP after UV oxidation. Analysis of NH,-N was determined by the Crooke and Smrpson (1971) method modified for auto-analysis. NOs-N was measured by the hydrazine reduction method of Downes (1978b). Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were determined after UV oxidation to nitrate. Further details are given in Howarp-WitiiaMs ef al. (1983). Detection limits with these analytical procedures were as follows: 0.2mg DRP m-3, 0.4 mg NO,-N m73, 0.5 mg NH,-N m-3, 1.0 mg TDP m~*, 1.0 mg TDN m-3. Suspended sediment samples were filtered onto preweighed precombusted GF/C filters which were then oven dried at 70 °C and reweighed. 3.3. Algal samples Algal material occurred in the form of crusts, mats and filamentous colonies. Early in the season, before first stream flows, these were still frozen and attached to the empty stream bed surfaces. Because of the problems of extreme patchiness of the algal communities and logistic limi- 520 C. Howarp-WIi.uiaMs et al. tations on the numbers of samples we adopted the following sampling protocol. In a series of selected 3 m reaches of each stream we collected six replicate samples each of 28 em? area from patches where we visually estimated that the algal community had reached maximum biomass. Three samples were taken from the middle and three from the stream edge at each reach. The data we report are therefore the maximum levels of biomass found in these streams. Collections were made before first flows (i.e. overwintering biomass) and again during the middle of the flow period when the algae had developed after a few weeks of contact with flowing water. Samples were stored frozen. Analysis for chlorophyll @ was carried out spectrophotometrically following extraction for 24 h in cold dimethyl sulphoxide (SHoaF and Lium 1976). Algal samples for taxonomic work were preserved with 2 %, glutaraldehyde solution. 3.4. Algal community cover At selected reaches of each stream percent cover of algal material was analysed by the point quadrat method (GreEt1c-Smity 1964). At each site points were taken at 10cm intervals in a series of transects from bank to bank until at least 300 points were analysed. At each point algal presence or absence was noted, as was a substratum size grading in three classes: <5 mm, 5 mm— 25mm, >25 mm. Confidence limits on these cover estimates were calculated from the binomial distribution (GREIG-SmituH 1964). 4. Results 4,1, Solar radiation and air temperatures Solar radiation and air temperatures are the most important features which influence water flows and thereby algal growth in these streams.

Of significance for the stream plant communities in the antarctic summer environment is the continuous solar radiation over 24h. Instantaneous records of photosynthetically active radiation in the wave band 400-700 nm from site C2 in the Taylor Valley show values ranging from 200-220 J m~2s~! (930-1000 pK m~2 s~1) at ca. 14,008, to only one order of magnitude less at 01.005. Thus, in spite of high latitude, abundant solar radiation occurs for plant growth in summer.

Seasonal variation in stream temperature at 1400 h each day in the Onyx River at Vanda Weir. ture from 5.2 to 2.0 °C occurred in the space of two hours at midday when clouds appeared, and incoming total solar radiation dropped from 552 J m7 2s~!to 177 J m-2s~!. At 14.00" the sky cleared, solar radiation rose to 454 J m-2s-t and water temperatures rapidly rose again to 4 °C. There was considerable variability in the maximum temperature values recorded Antarctic Stream Ecosystems 523 for the streams. The warniest temperatures were recorded in Fryxell (max. 9.5 °C) and at site C2 in the Whangamata (max. 11.0°C) streams. Even the relatively fast flowing Onyx attained 8.5 °C at the lower reaches. However, the maximum recorded in the Adams Stream was 5.2 °C and in Northern Rookery stream was 3.3 °C. Water temperatures at 14.00" (daily maxima) were obtained for the Onvx River at Vanda weir for the period of flow (Fig. 9b). Temperatures on the first day of flow (16 December 1983) reached 9.5° and on 21 January 1984 8.5 °C. These corresponded with the periods of warin air temperatures (Fig. 8). 4.3, Streain discharges Most of the streanis began to flow in early to mid-December 1983 and by late January 1984 were starting to freeze permanently. However, there were major differences in flows between streams (Table 2), and variations at seasonal and diel time scales within streams. From the long-term records of Cruxn (1981) we can distinguish the following “typical” pattern of flow in the Onyx River: an initial slow flow at the beginning of the season followed by an increase in flow to mid-January and then a decrease to February when flow stops. Overlying this pattern are a series of conspicuous flow events associated with warmer weather periods, and superiniposed on this pattern is a marked diel change in flow. Flows in some seasons are stronger than others. The seasonal hydrograph for the lower reaches of the Onyx River during our study (Fig. 10) show high discharges associated with the two spells of warm weather. One of these coincided with the period of first flow on the Onyx River when the largest discharges vet recorded (ca. 15 mm? s7~!) occurred. Fig. 11 shows a series of diel studies on discharge for several cf the streams in mid-January and for early December for the Northern Rookery stream.

Data are from sites B2, A3, C2 and Vanda Weir. Early in the season, when flows are typically low in the small streams, no marked diel pattern was evident (Fig. 11a). During this period stream flows were greatly influenced by slight weather changes at any time. Later in the season diel periodicity dominated the flow pattern (Fig. 11b) although weather conditions sometimes altered stream temperatures (Fig. 9a). In Northern Rookery, Adams and Onyx streams, minimum flows occurred at about 14.005, and maximum flows at 16.00—18.005, shortly after minimum and maximum water temperatures. CHINN (1981) reported on the rapid changes in flow in the Onyx between 24.005 and 05.00 which are probably typical for most Victoria Land streams. The stream surface iced over in the early hours of morning (e.g. Fig. 9a), and flows dropped sharply. The ice formed into small “are terraces” which blocked the stream particularly in the boulder pavement area (Fig. 2). With the appearance of the sun from behind the ranges, the ice melted and dispersed. The release of ponded water caused a rapid rise in discharge which then settled to a steady flow. Aspect and slope are, however, critical in determining the daily discharge pattern. If the slope is too steep, this damming effect is small and flows will gradually decline as ice becomes thicker (e.g. Adams stream). The importance of aspect can be seen by a comparison (Fig. 11) of the diel variations in the Adams stream (glacier face oriented east to north) with the Whangamata (glacier face oriented west to south). Discharge in the Adams began to rise at 12.00" once the sun had reached its northern zenith. By 16.00, with the sun in the west, the flows from the glacier face began to drop and by 20.00" the stream began to freeze. In contrast the discharge from the Whangamata began to rise only at 14.00" when the sun was in the west and maximum discharge was reached at 20.00 with the sun southwest and shining directly on the glacier face. After this the sun moved below the tops of the Kukri Hills and flow stopped as the stream froze over. Antarctic Stream Ecosystems 525 4.4, Nutrients in glaciers and streams 4.4.1. Nutrient levels in glacier ice Glacier ice is a complex mixture of ground-up rock material, wind-blown sand and silts, solid and dissolved salts, and frozen water. The chemistry of the ice reflects the long term changes in local snow precipitation which includes wind blown particulates, nitrates derived from atmospheric oxidative processes, marine-derived salts, and, in the region of Mt Erebus, volcanic inputs. The powdered granular rock material in the glaciers reflects the geology of the area through which they move. Sampling of glacier faces to determine the origin of meltwater for the streams poses problems as often the face is clearly made up of ice layers, each with different chemical properties. A large proportion of the runoff originates from the top surface of the glacier, where nutrients in local precipitation would constitute a considerable proportion of those in the meltwater. Nutrient levels varied between layers of the same glacier (Table 2), and from Table 2.

Of particular interest are the relatively high levels of NO,-N and DRP in the fresh icicle melt off the glacier face early in the season. NO,-N and DRP values in snow adjacent to the streams were also high. All these samples were collected before stream flows in November 1983, with the exception of the Mt Bird Ice Sheet which was sampled in early December when the stream flow had just begun (see Fig. 11a). 4.4.2. Nutrients in the first flows The initial flows over the stream bed are often small and may be under an ice cover. We were able to sample first flows in the Adams stream and the upper Onyx, and the front of water (melthead) as it moved down the main Onyx river at two 526 C. Howarv-WI.L.LrAMs eé al. sites (Table 3). Values of inorganic nitrogen were higher than glacier ice in all cases and DRP in first flows was higher in the Onyx system than in the Lower Wright Glacier. These nutrient levels were substantially higher than those in stream waters following the first day of flow. Table 3.

Vanda CANFIELD and GREEN (1983) suggested that the initial pulse of nutrients (particularly nitrate) in the Onyx at Vanda weir was due to the flushing ont of water from Lake Bull, 2km upstream, where nitrification had occurred through winter. Our data would not support this contention for the 1983/84 season as high nitrate levels were recorded in the river at site O2 well above Lake Bull one day prior to the river reaching Vanda weir. 4.4.3. Nutrients from streambed soils Nutrients leached from streambed soils on contact with the first flows were estimated from experiments on these soils conducted prior to the initial melt. Soil cores 5.0 nim deep and 5670 mm2 in area were collected from the Adanis (site Ai) and Table 4.

Controls were containers with water alone. Water was decanted and filtered after 12h. Nutrients released (Table 4) were calculated from experimental minus control concentrations and expressed as mg released m7? of soil surface. Higher concentrations of DIN and total N were extracted from the Adams stream soil. Total phosphorus release was largely DRP and was similar for samples from both streams. Antarctic Stream Ecosystems D27 4.4.4, Nutrients in stream waters Once the stream flow begins, nutrient levels are influenced by levels in the source glacier ice, characteristics of the stream bed sediments and any biological interactions which may occur within the stream. In addition, variability in nutrient levels is caused hy freeze concentration when a variable proportion of the stream water turns to ice leaving the salts in solution. Thus various scales of temporal and spatial variahilitv are inherent features of the nutrient concentrations in the streamWaters. 4.4.4.1. Variability between streams Stream to stream variability in meltwater nutrients was evaluated from measurements taken during mid-season (early January) at the time of day of maximum discharge. Due to diel freeze-thaw cycles (Fig. 11) these values represent the minimum concentrations for the day. Reactive phosphorus and dissolved organic phosphorus ranged from low values (<2 mg m7") in the Onyx to 100mg m~> at site B3 below the penguin colony of the Northern Rookerv stream. Ammonium-N and NO.-N ranged from <0.6 mg m7? to 2 mgm} respectively in the lower Frvxell stream, to a maximum of 156 and 365 mg m7? at Northern Rookery stream. Even streams from adjacent glaciers could differ markedly, e.g. Fryxell stream and Whangamata stream (Fig. 1) originate on two adjacent glaciers 5 km apart in the Tavlor Valley but N and P compounds analysed were 2 to 10 times higher in concentration in Whangamata than in Fryxell. This is due to differences in the nutrient content of the source glaciers (Table 2). 4.4.4.2. Longitudinal variability within streams Three types of streams can be distinguished on the basis of upstream and downstream values of inorganic nutrients: (1) inorganic N and P concentrations are more or less constant with distance downstream (e.g. Whangamata) (2) inorganic N and P concentrations increase downstream (e.g. Northern Rookery streal) (3) inorganic N and P concentrations decrease downstream (e.g. Adams, Fryxell). Streams of type 1 were generally of high velocity (>0.5 ms7~!) and contained no obvious biological activity. The stream bed was unstable, and the waters turbid with shifting sediments. In the type 2 stream the increasing nutrients were derived from allochthonous inputs from the penguin rookery and from the ornithogenic soils through which the stream flows. High levels of NO,-N occurred in the lower reaches of this stream (‘Table 5d) but we also recorded extremely high (for natural waters) nitrite concentrations. Values up to 80 mg NO,-N m7? were recorded from this stream on 8 December 1983. Streams of type 3 had significant algal growths that presumably stripped nutrients from the water flowing over them. These changes in concentrations were not due to dilution as the source glacier was the only water supply to the streams except for the Onyx, which had some small side tributaries. A slight increase in discharge occurred in the Fryxell stream from 0.05—0.06 m's~! between the upper and lower reaches on the day of sampling, but this was small compared with the reduction in N and P compounds. Downstream decreases in nutrient concentrations in type 3 streams were therefore due to biological removal rather than dilution.

For example, in Northern Rookery stream sediment concentration rose two orders of magnitude between low and high flows (Table 9). Discharge in the Onyx on 17/18 Dec 1983 was less variable with time of day than the small streams, and similarly the suspended sediment load was relatively constant. However, turbidity rose sharply with the sudden increase in discharge on 18 December (Table 9). 4.6, Stream algal communities 4.6.1. Algal species composition In many of the streams, particularly clear running waters, the rocks, gravels and sands of the streambed were covered with thick mats and films. The most common communities were black, mucilaginous mats, up to 10 mm thick, composed of Nostoc associated with a lesser abundance of Oscillatoriaceae (Phormidium spp., Oscillatoria spp., Microcoleus vaginatus) and pink, grey-green or orange cohesive layers solely of Oscillatoriaceae. Dark red to black surface films of Gloeocapsa kuetzingiana were common on the rocks at several stream locations and green tufts of Tribonema clegans and Binuclearva tectorum occurred in at least two streams. The composition of algal communities commonly changed along the length of each streanl. The zonation in the Adams Stream was typical (Fig. 15). In steep areas adjacent to the glacier. Nostoc commune and mats of Oscillatoriaceae were common. The latter consisted mostly of P.luminosum, P. uncinatum and some Calothrix spp. However, in stony reaches only the oscillatoriacean mats occurred between the stones. Large stones and boulders had a vertical zonation. The tops and upwardfacing surfaces were covered with a reddish crust of Gloeocapsa spp. with associated diatoms and some Oscillatoria spp. Often a film of Phormidium spp. occurred near the base of the rocks and the low light zone under the rocks was inhabited by bright green ribbons of Prasiola calophylla. Long filamentous strands of B. tectorum, up to 5 cm in length, were common along stream margins and attached to the downstream sides of large rocks. Where the stream levelled out on alluvial sands, the algal community comprised diatoms (Hantzschia amphioxys, Navicula spp.) with some oscillatoriaceans and spherical unicellular chlorophytes. The flora of the Fryxell stream has been described in detail by Boapy (1982) who recorded a similar structure on the stones to that shown in Fig. 11. In Fryxell stream the cyanophyte Chamaesiphon subglobosus was also a common constituent of the dim Antarctic Stream Ecosystems 533              SITE Nostoc commune N. fuscens mat A1 Oscitfatoriacean mat: O. sancta, Phormidium uncinatum, P. faminosum, plus Hantzschia Crust. of COS AL APM a amphioxys and Navicula spp. Gloeocapsa spp. with Cyclotelia sp. and some 8inuciearia sp.

Sites A1—A4 shown on Figure 2. 4 ight community under stones in the upper reaches of the stream. Prasiola calophylla was found in the same habitat but lower down on the stream. Stones in the upper reaches of the Fryxell stream had few epilithic algae, but in the middle and lower reaches, periphyton of both mat and crust forms was abundant on rock surfaces and between rocks. Dense black Nostoc spp. mats occurred where the stream reached Lake Fryxell. The streams from the Commonwealth Glacier commonly had algal mats in their lower reaches and where stream velocities slowed over gravel beds. In the Whangamata Stream, samples of algal mat were dominated by Phormidium frigidum and Oscillatoria sancta. Red coloured epilithic crusts on the rocks comprised Gloeocapsa kuetzingiana and the diatom Hantzschia amphioxys. BROADY (1981) recorded a similar pattern of species from this stream, as well as an abundance of other unidentified pennate diatoms. Of particular interest was the presence of heterocystous blue-green algae (Anabaena spp. and Nodularia harveyana) which were found nearby in ponds 534 C. Howarp-WIi.itaMs ef al, of the confluence of the Wales Stream and stream CC-2 from the Commonwealth glacier (Fig. 12). T'axononiic analyses were carried out on samples collected from the main secticn of the Onyx River at two sites-the upper reaches just below Lake Brownworth, and the boulder pavement area 4 km upstream from Lake Vanda. Rocks in the upper reaches were covered by a black crust of Gloeccapsa kuetzingiana. Phormidium cf. corium and P. uncinatum, normally mat forming species were associates. Gloeccapsa sp., Navicula cf. fragiluricides and a sarcinoid chlorophyte were found in the sandy substrates of the shallow depressions in this upper reach. The algal mats of the downstream boulder pavement area were dominated by Phormidium spp. (2. laminosum and P. frigidum, with P. fragile less common). Diatoms, (4fantzschia amphioxys, Navicula muticopsis, N. cryptocephala, Stauroneis anceps and Tabellaria sp.) were common on sandy substrata in this area, but were scarce where dense Phormidiwm mats oecurred between boulders. The Northern Rookery stream had no detectable algal growth over most of its length, but ina shallow slow-moving side-arm near the ice-sheet, there was an epilithic community mostly consisting of Phormidium ef. corium, P. frigidum, Binuclearia and Navicula muticopsis. Gloeocapsa kuetzingiana and Stichococcus sp. were also found in lesser abundance. BRoapy (1981) also recorded thin green epilithic crusts of Stichococeus bucillaris in the upper parts of this stream close to the Mt Bird Ice Sheet. In adjacent slower flowing streams and seeps which received melt from the penguin colonies, luxuriant filamentous growths of Ulothrizx sp. occurred. Phormidium spp., Navicula muticopsis and Binuclearia tectorum were less abundant associates. As well as changing along the length of streams, algal communities also often changed across the width. A transect across the middle reaches of the Fryxell Stream showed the following pattern. On moist ground bordering the stream channel there were cushions of moss with Nostoc sp. mats on the stream edge. Within the stream different zones were recognizable due to their various colours and textures. An outer pink-purple zone near the stream edge consisted of oscillatoriacean taxa including M. vaginatus, and embedded within this were dark brown Nostoc sp. colonies. Large stones further into the main channel supported blackish epilithic crusts on their upper surfaces. These were dominated by G. kuetzingiana and Schizothrix cf. uentarctica. Brown epilithic crusts on the same stones had P. uncinatum as the dominant oscillatoriacean component. Covering the sand of the deepest, central part of the channel was a yellow-brown oscillatoriacean felt dominated by Phormadium laminosum. 4.6.2. Algal cover and biomass Percent cover of the algal communities differed markedly both within and between streams. In general, maximum cover was recorded in clear streams, while the highly turbid flowing waters were devoid of conspicuous growths except in quieter, shallow side-arms or washes. Fig. 16 illustrates this effect in three contrasting stream types: the Onyx, where abundant algal growth occurs only in limited stretches of the stream, the clear Adams Stream which has an abundance of algae throughout, and the highly turbid Whangamata and Northern Rookery streams where algal growth is minimal. Algal cover was negatively correlated (r= —0.76, p<9.001) with the proportion of fine sediment in the stream channels (Fig. 17). The effect of the presence of this unstable material was apparent in the middle reaches of the Onyx River where algae were visible only on the edges of the channels where large pebbles and stones occurred, and where this substratum was not continually shifting.

A more detailed analysis of one reach of the Onyx River showed that four distinct algal habitats could be recognised (Table 10). Habitat types 1-3 were areas which were flooded continuously over a diurnal period. The algal cover increased in inverse proportion to the presence of fine sediments as would be expected from Fig. 16. Habitat type 4, although having suitable substrata for algal growth, was inundated only for short periods each day, and as a consequence, 9/, algal cover was reduced. It was apparent from our analyses, that the °/) cover of algae present before the first flows (i.e. the overwintering algal stock) make up a considerable proportion of the mid-summer °/, cover. This proportion ranged from 44 %/) in the Whangamata stream to a high 73 °/, in the Fryxell stream. However, at two sites (one in the Onyx and one in the Whangamata), sediments transported by the stream during summer smothered algae which had been recorded before flows began and the mid-summer cover was less than that originally present. The apparent high overwintering stock of algae was investigated further by algal biomass measurements. Chlorophylla of the periphyton per unit stream surface area ranged from undetectable in fast flowing stream reaches with unstable sediments to a very high 57 ug cm? in slow flowing areas where thick Nostoc mats had developed (Adams Stream, Fryxell Stream). Undetectable to very low values were recorded in the Northern Rookery stream and the Whangamata stream, with a mean (+SEE) for 6 sites in each stream of 1.85 (+ 0.083) and 0.02 (+0.02) ug em? respectively. Chlorophyll a values in the Onyx River varied from 12 ug cm? in the upper reaches (site O1) to 0.03ug cm~2 in some of the mid-stream sections (Fig. 18a). The trend for biomass followed that of °/, cover with maximal! values in the upper and lower reaches where a stable riverbed occurred. In those sections of the river with unstable sediments in the channel we found that although biomass was low it was usually higher on the more stable channel banks than in the centre.

The highest algal biomass occurred in the Adams stream (Fig. 18b) and the Fryxell stream (Fig. 18c). The samples shown in Fig. 18b for the top site close to the glacier were collected from the main stream channel. However, the area adjacent to the glacier was a complex hydrological system of seeps and channels with very varied algal biomass accumulations. The extent of these appeared to increase with decreasing flow rates and decrease with degree of channelisation of the stream (cf. Table 11). Data from the Adams and Fryxell streams illustrates the quantitative importance of the overwintering biomass to the final biomass which develops by mid-season. Overwintering chlorophyll a made up between 20 and 100 9 of the values recorded later in the season (Fig. 18b, c). In the Whangamata stream and parts of the Onyx, biomass decreased through the season due to shifting stream sediments. At some locations, very different algal communities and areal biomasses occurred above and below the stream boulders (Fig. 15). In the Adams stream, for instance, the reddish film of oscillatoriaceans on the upper surfaces of rocks (Fig. 15) had a relatively low chlorophyll content per unit area (1.5 ug em~2), but contained rich carotenoid pigmentation, presumably as a protection against bright light.

Discussion A useful review of high latitude stream ecology has been compiled by Harrrr (1981). This exclusively cites Northern Hemisphere examples and points to the lack of data from Antarctica. Harper concludes that arctic streams differ from streams elsewhere only by being subjected to extreme photoperiods and low rates of input of radiant energy. However, it is evident from our studies of the streams of southern Victoria Land that there are several other important differences which, in combination, separate them from both Northern Hemisphere high latitude streams and temperate streams. In brief these features include: (i) the streams are all entirely glacier-fed, rather than snow-fed which has a significant effect on their hydrology (ii) during the short summer melt period there are marked diurnal! changes in water flow (iii) the ice in the stream channels ablates during winter due to wind erosion leaving a dry, frozen stream bed and an associated freeze-dried epilithon. (iv) most of the streams flow through catchments with, at most, a few small patches of mosses and lichens and with a sparse soil microflora. Where significant biological activity occurs in the catchment it is associated with marine animals (birds, seals) rather than with vegetation. Glacier-fed streams of the arctic zone show characteristics (i) and (ii) (MEIER 1964, WENDLER et al. 1972). Desert watercourses elsewhere show highly irregular flows and often flow through catchments with very little biological activity (c. f. (iv) above). Input of allochthonous material in desert streams is often negligible relative to autochthonous inputs (NarmAn 1976, Dance 1981). Srerran (1972) found that gla- Antarctic Stream Ecosystems 539 cier-fed streams in Alaska and Lappland were different to snow-fed streams of the area, being characterised by lower nutrient concentrations and lower temperatures. The streams of Victoria Land, therefore share some physical characteristics with Northern Hemisphere glacier streams and some with desert streams elsewhere, but the combination of characters (i)—(iv) above, and the special feature (iii) which we have not. seen recorded for other streams, set them aside as a very distinct group of lotic ecosystems. Perhaps the most comparable streams are those of the high Arctic polar deserts briefly referred to in BLiss et al. (1984) but for which we have as yet seen no descriptions. They appear to be snow-fed and flow for 7-14 days each year. The annual freezing and ablation of ice to the streambed imposes a particularly harsh set of environmental conditions on the lotic flora and microfauna of Antarctic streams which must sustain several months at temperatures to —55 °C. In STEFFAN’s (1972) consideration of N. Hemisphere glacier-fed streams, he pointed to their low nutrient status as a special characteristic. Whilst this may be true for some Antarctic streams, none appear to be ultra-oligotrophic, and high nutrient levels are found in two sets of conditions. First, when streams flow through penguin rookeries they are enriched with nutrients. Secondly, high nutrient levels are associated with first flows (Table 3, and see WEAND et al. 1977, CANFIELD and GREEN 1983). This is a transient phenomenon. VINCENT and Howarp-WILLIAMS (1986) suggest that this initial high nutrient pulse may be advantageous to the stream flora which, like terrestrial! desert flora (E1cKMEYER 1979, 1982) rapidly resumes metabolic activity on rehydration. The source of these early flow nutrients has not been clearly established. There are however, three possibilities: 1. Glacier surfaces. Although glacier ice is by no means pure water (Table 2) inorganic N and P concentrations in the ice are generally low. (Organic N and P are discussed elsewhere—DowNeEs ef al. in press.). However, water samples from the initial melting surfaces of the glaciers, collected from dripping icicles, had relatively high N and P contents (Table 2). We do not as yet fully understand the reasons for this but salts may be concentrated on glacier surfaces by continuous freeze-thaw cycles, and they may be deposited as wind-blown particulates from the adjacent land surfaces and from the sea. All the glacier sites studied were within 20 km of the sea, and with the strong winds which blow in the region we may expect considerable marine aerosol development, movement and precipitation. Such aerosols will coat the surfaces of the glaciers and accumulate in winter to be released with first flows. Visually conspicuous quantities of soil and sediments from adjacent land surfaces accumulate on the glaciers and salts from this material may be largely released or leached during first flows each year. A further source of atmospherically derived high nitrate on these glaciers has been postulated and is believed to originate by atmospheric oxidation of N, gas, possibly by auroral activity (ZELLER and PARKER 1981). 2. Snowdrifts. Snow in drifts in stream channels and on adjacent slopes has higher nutrient levels than glacier ice, and would contribute to the first melt. 3. Streambed sediments. These can potentially supply nutrients (Table 4 and see Horan ef al. 1977), particularly to the first flows by three processes: nutrients may be frozen out and deposited from the previous year’s stream, the ice of which has ablated; nutrients can be generated from soil weathering processes on the dry streambeds over winter; nutrients may be generated from the oxidation or weathering of algal materiel from the previous season’s growth. However, streambed sediments are not likely to be as important to the early nutrient pulse as glaciers and snow. Whilst in another study (Downss ef al. in press) it has been demonstrated that organic N and P may be derived in some quantity from streambed sources, this is unlikely to be the case with inorganic nutrients. For instance, if we multiply the area of 35* 540 C. Howarp-WI.uraMs ef al. streambed which is covered with water on the first day of flow by the quantities of nutrients released per unit area (Table 4) we can estimate the total released amount by the streambed. Dividing this by the total discharge over the first 24h gives an approximation of the likely rise in concentration of the nutrient due to streambed processes. The values calculated for the Onyx River, for instance, are 1 mg m7"? DRP and 0.6 mg m3 of NO,-N, negligible amounts compared with the actual concentrations (Table 3, Fig. 13). Very high nutrient levels in the lower reaches of the Northern Rookery Stream are obviously derived from the penguin rookeries, but the high proportion of the oxidised form of inorganic N is of interest. Here, we recorded up to 80 mg m~3 of nitrite-N and up to 4g m7 of nitrate-N. The soil nitrogen originates from penguin guano, and is mostly in the form of uric acid which decomposes rapidly to ammonium (SPr—ER and CowLine 1984) resulting in soil concentrations of 40 mg NH,-N g7'. These ornithogenic soils are therefore very different from most soils elsewhere where organic matter is largely derived from plants. SPEIR and CowLinG (1984) speculated that in addition to natural weathering, some of this ammonium could be converted to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria. Our data on the high NOQ.-N and NOs-N concentrations in the streamwaters flowing through these soils would suggest that nitrification is an important process in the summer period here. Nitrification has been recorded from penguin rookery soils at subantarctic Marion Island (LinDEBOoM 1984). At the mean soil temperature of 6°, low rates were found, but in one experiment the process oxidised as much as 100 mg N m~? day~! when the incubation temperature was raised to 20 °C, a soil temperature he sometimes recorded in the field. Clearly, at the Northern Rookery, substrates are not limiting and soil temperatures can rise to 10 °C making these alkaline soils ideal sites for nitrification for at least one or two months each year resulting in high levels of oxidised nitrogen in the stream water. However, it is noteworthy that this stream, with its high nutrient concentrations, supported no significant algal growth. In contrast, the Adams stream had fairly low nutrient levels and was biologically very rich. The physical regime of the streams seems to be of greater importance than nutrients in determining biological activity. Streambed stability and the amount of suspended sediments which scour the periphyton are apparently the major physical factors affecting algal growth. This conclusion is supported by a correspondence between water clarity and algal cover: turbid streams were largely devoid of algae while all clear waters had abundant growth. In a series of artificial substratum growth experiments in these streams there was an inverse correlation between algal biomass accumulation and maximum suspended sediment load (V1NCENT and Howarp-WILLIAMS 1986). The standing crop which survives from one summer to the next usually lies close to the maximum sustainable crop for the whole season. High biomass can apparently only develop by small increments over many years on a stable substratum which lasts from year to year. Sediment load was a highly variable component of the Dry Valley streams (Table 7, and see HoEHN ef al. 1977). High sediment loads are a characteristic of Alaskan and Alpine glacier streams (MEIER 1964, CoLLtins 1983) and are a conspicuous feature of the south temperate New Zealand glacial streams. Diurnal variability in suspended load concentrations has been noted for Alaskan glacial streains (Starr 1972) and is apparently a function of diel variation in stream flow conditions. The decrease in sediment load with distance downstream (Table 8) is also a feature of Alaskan glacial streams (MEIER 1964). However, many of the streams we examined had flow rates too low to move considerable quantities of sediment (Table 7) and it was these which supported maximum algal growth. The algal communities of Victoria Land streams were dominated by the Cyanophyceae (Tables 10, 11, Fig. 15). Broapy (1982) noted that this group comprised Antarctic Stream Ecosystems D41 63 , of the total algal taxa in all antarctic streams studied up to that time. Cyanophyceans are known to be highly resistant to freezing stresses (DUBOIS and KAPUTSKA 1983) which could confer an advantage over other groups of algae. The diatom flora of the streams is certainly impoverished relative to that in the benthos of the adjacent dry valley lakes where freezing would not occur, perhaps, because this group is not as physiologically resistant to freezing as the Cyanophyceae. A further advantage which may be conferred on the heterocystous N.-fixing Cyanophyceans is the low N/P ratio of the Victoria Land streamwaters. Inorganic N/P ratios of only 2—3 occurred in all streams except the Onyx (see data in Table 5). The Nostoc commune colonies we examined had abundant heterocysts, and N-fixing species of Anabaena and Nodularia were recorded from ponded portions of streams in the Taylor Valley (Fig. 12). ALLNuTT ef al. (1981) detected acetylene reduction (although rates were low) in algal mats containing heterocystous Cyanophyceae in shallow waters on the edges of the lakes of this region. Nitrogen fixation remains an unquantified component of the southern Victoria Land flowing water environments. Despite low temperatures and a brief season of streamflow, antarctic streams can support an abundant algal epilithon. They contain chlorophyll a levels comparable to the highest values reported from streams of the temperate zone (cf. Lock 1981), and maintain a viable overwintering biomass that comprises a large percentage of the late season streambed cover. These communities live in a structured, linear ecosystem that has a well-defined point source of water and dissolved materials (the glacier), longitudinal gradients of sediment load and nutrients, but minimal exchanges of mass and energy with the surrounding catchment through which it flows. 6. Summary Running waters originating from glacial melt are a seasonal feature of Antarctica and are especially prevalent in the vicinity of McMurdo Sound. We have sampled 24 of these waters and have conducted detailed studies on five contrasting streams. Streamwater temperatures showed a marked diel variability (freezing to 11 °C) which was sensitive to ambient air temperatures and insolation. Discharges ranged from 0.01 m3 s~!in small streams to 15 m3 s7! in the Onyx River and varied at diel and weekly time scales although annual flow periods were short (ca. 6 weeks). We found that aspect and slope were major determinants in the flow regimes of these streams; the time of day of maximum discharge depended on the orientation of thesource glacier relative to the sun. Nutrients (dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus compounds) were analysed in glaciers, and streamwaters on a diel and seasonal basis. Karly meltwaters had 10—20 times higher levels of dissolved N and P than those later in the season. There was considerable variability in nutrient concentrations between streams at maximum discharge (e.g. dissolved reactive phosphorus ranged from <1imgm7? in Fryxell Stream to >100 mg m~? in Northern Rookery Stream) within streams on a diel basis and within streams with distance from a glacier to the stream outflow. Variability was due to: the presence of dense algal mats which removed nutrients, penguin rookeries which added nutrients and different concentrations in the source glaciers. The suspended sediment content of the stream waters was shown to vary over four orders of magnitude with deep fast flowing streams exhibiting maximum sediment loads (>600 g m~3). Diel changes in sediment loads were observed and these were directly related to discharge. Algal communities were made up predominantly of blue-green algae (Phormidium, 542 C. Howargp-WILLIAMs et al. Oscillatoria, Nostoc, Gloeocapsa). Other important genera including the green algae Binuclearia and Prasiola were the tribophyte Tribonema, and the pennate diatoms Hantzschia and Navicula. Water flow rates and substrate type influenced species composition and biomass. Biomass ranged from undetectable in shifting sands to values in excess of 25 yg chla cm? in stable mat communities. Physical! factors (turbidity, flow, sediment type) were of greater importance than nutrients in determining algal standing crop. 7.
