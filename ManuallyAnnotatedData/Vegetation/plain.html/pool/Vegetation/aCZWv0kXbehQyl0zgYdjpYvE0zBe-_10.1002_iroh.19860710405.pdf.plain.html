Antarctic Stream Ecosystems : Variability in EnvironmentaI Properties and Algal Community Structure

key words: Antarctic streams, epilithic algae, nutrients, hydrology, glacier melt

The variability inphysical, chemicaland biologicalpropertieswas examinedforanumberof glacier melt streams in south Victoria Land, Antarctica. Streams flowed for between one and two months. Stream water temperatures (range=0-11 &quot;C) varied over short (hr) time scales whilst discharges varied considerably between streams (range 0.001-15 mJ s-1) and over die1 cycles. Solar radia- tion and air temperature were major determinants of stream discharge. Variability in discharge was reflected in variability in nutrient chemistry and sediment load. Nitrogen and phosphorus varied considerably between streams; the meltwaters early in summer contained 10-20 times higher levels of dissolved X and P than later in the season. Within stream nutrient levels were modified by dense algal growths and penguin rookeries. Epilithic algal communities were made up predominantly of cyanophyceae which formed mats and crusts. Longitudinal and horizontal variability of species in the communities in selected streams is described. Analyses of algal cover and biomass (chlorophyll a )  show that substrate type and flow rates are of greater importance than nutrients in influencing algal abundance and biomass. I n  some streams biomass values of over 20 !ig Ch. n cni-2 were recorded. murh of which remains viable but inactive over the ant- arctic winter.

1. Introduction

Stream ecosystenis are a seasonal feature of Antarctica. Nore than 95 percent of the continent is covered by thick ice, with air temperatures rarely above freezing. Yet for a few weeks each summer sinall seeps, streams and rivers flow within various regions near the coast. Flowing waters are particularly abundant in the vicinity of McMurdo Sound (Fig, 1, ca. 77  “S 185 OE).More than one hundred streatus flow froni coastal icesheets t o  the sea, or inland froni alpine and piedmont glaciers located in the “Dry Valleys”, a 10000 kin2 area containing deep valleys largely free of snow and ice. All of the streams lie within catchments devoid of plants more advanced than iiiosses, and are exposed t o  extremes of cold (to -55 “C in  winter) and aridity (annual precipitation less than 7 cni in the Dry Valleys). Many of the streambeds are coated with thick epilithic mats and filiiis. These are doniinated by algae, with associated bacteria, fungi and  niicroherbivores (protozoa, rotifers, neiiiatodes, tardigrades) which niust survive a highly erratic flow regime, wide variations in temperature and  nutrient content, rapid freezing and thawing and a brief growing season. Allochthonous inputs to these waters from the sparse microbial coniniunities in the catchment are probably small, although considerable niaterial can enter froni the source glacier (DOWNXSet aE. in press). Unlike many temperate streaniwaters (e.g. FISHERand LIKENS 1973) the upstrcain origin of nutrients is a clearly defined source, and  within-stream, rather than catchment processes dominate the subsequent transfer of mass and energy. Until recently these streams have been a neglected aspect of biological studies in Antarctica (PARKER1981, VINCENTand VINCENT in press). A detailed sequence of hydrological nieasurernerits is available for the largest Antarctic flowing water, t h e  Onyx River (CIIINN1974, CHINN1981) and  notes on hydrological changes in snialler streanis are given in HEYWOOD(1977), HOEIINet al. (1977) and  WEANUet mZ. (1977). Geocheinical attributes of Dry Valley streams and  their influence on the chemistry of inland lakes have been exaiirined (TORIIet al. 1971, HomN  et al. 1977, CANFIELD

~ i i d GREEK 1983, WEAXI)e t  d .  1977). Published biological work has centered on the taxononiy of certain algal communities (BROADY1981, 1982, HIRANO1979, 1983, SEAUVRGet n l .  1979) and photosynthetic rates of two types of epilithic coni- inunity are documented in VINCENTand HOWARD-WILLIAMS(1986). Antarctic streanis form unusual ecosystenis but there have heen no previous at-  tempts to make a combined study of their communities and environrriental proper- ties. I n  the present study we examined the physical, cheiiiical and biological charac- teristics of a diverse range of streams in southern Victoria Land in order to compare their basic ecosystem attributes with lotic systenis elsewhere.</pre>

2.1. Northern Rookery Strenrn

This stream is situated near the northern end of the Cape Bird ice free area. It starts along the M t  Bird Ice Sheet (Fig. 2) and  falls some 100-110 ni ultiiiiately discharging into the Ross Sea. The stream falls sharply down steepunstable iiioraines i n t o  a valley where it cuts  through itioraine and  nutrient rich ornithogeriic soils (SPEIRand COWLING1984) created by a large (40000nests) Adelie penguin rookery (Fig. 3). This stream, like others in the area which flow over steep unstable slopes, has a high suspended particle load giving it a grey appearance.

2.2. Adams Stream

The st,reain, 2.7 krii long, originates along the edges of f,he Adaim glacier 350 111

above sea level and discharges into Lake Miers (Fig. 2) in the Miers Valley. The stream divides about midway down its full reach with part flowing down an  exten- sive algal rich wash area which c0nnect.s with t,he Miers stream; the bulk (&gt;70&quot;i,,) continues over a gravel bed in a well defined 7 ni wide channel to site A3 (Fig. 4).

2.3. Whangamata Stream (unofficial name)

This stream (5.6 kin long) starts about 180ni above the level of Lake Fryxell along the west side of the Commonwealth glacier. For the first 1kni of its length the gradient is steep with icefalls from the glacier which forin small dams in places. The stream channel here runs along the foot of the glacier on old lacustrine sedi- ments between large (-= 1 ni diain.) boulders. For the next 1 kin downstreani the gradient is reduced slightly to a point where the stream leaves the glacier foot, cuts through loose moraine and  flows across a flat sandy alluvial fan (“the wash”, Fig. 2). The gradient then increases slightly, and the final 800 ni of stream leads over rocks and gravel. The stream water was characterised by a turbid appearance during peak flows each day.

2.4. Fryxell Stream

The main stream (2 kni long) starts along the east side of the Canada glacier sonie XOOin above the level of Lake Fryxell. The stream rapidly increases in size along the first kni as  nunierous ice streams contribute from various portions of the glacier. This upper 1 kin is steep and  the stream flows over rocks and boulders. A t  site F1 (Fig. 2) the gradient decreases as  the channel flows away froni the glacier. Consider- able algal growth was evident a t  this point,. A small flow from a moss “flush” area and a large pond on the right bank join the stream some 500ni below site F1. From here the stream forins a 500m stretch of gravels and  stones with a dense algal cover. A steep 200 ni bouldery section follows (Fig. 2) and  at its lower reaches on the edge of L. Fryxell the stream spreads out across a dense Nostoc conimunity growing as  thiek mats on a sandy substrate. We measured discharges of 0.06 ni%-1 (Table 1 )  and  the stream water was always clear.

2.5. Onyx River

This river, the largest in Antarctica can be conveniently divided into two sections, the Upper Onyx (4.8kiii) and the Main Onyx (30km). Upper Onyx: This starts a t  the junction of the Greenwood and Wright Valleys ca. 300 in above sea level and receives water from the Greenwood and  Lower Wright Glaciers. I t s  flow along the foot of the Lower Wright Glacier increases steadily until it leaves the glacier face i n  an  alluvial sandy plain leading t o  Lake Brownworth, 277 n i  above sea level (Fig. 2). Ice falls from the 30 m high glacier face have resulted in darns along the river in which the only algal mats in this stretch were seen. Flows continue around the ice nioat 011 t,he northern side of Lake Brownworth t o  the exit from the lake where the Main Onyx begins. CHI” (i981) estimated that  86 O,/o of the Main Onyx flow origi- nated from the Upper Onyx. Main Onyx: This section of the river falls 190 ni over the 30 kni reach from Lake Brownworth to Lake Vanda. I n  the upper 1.5 k m  stretch, the river flows over a stable stony bed (gradient 0.0037m - ni-1) with a series of shallow depressions rich i n  algal material. The river t,hen increases in slope (gradient 0.0075 ni m-1) with an  unstable bed as it cuts through the Trilogy Moraine complex, and receives inter- mittent inputs from the Clark and Denton streams.

519 ties could be seen on rocks on the submerged sides of the river. From 6-13 kni below Lake Brownworth the river meanders forming braided channels through a series of alluvial fans (gradient 0.0020 111 1 ni-1). Little algal material was visible here, but it occurred on the rocks where the streairi breaches the large Loop Moraine a t  ca. 14 kiii down (Fig. 2 ) .  From here t o  4k m  upstream from Lake Vanda (gradient 0.0040111 . i i i -1)  the river meanders through sandy braided channels (Site 02 ,  Figures 5 ,  6). At this point it enters a wide (800 111 arross) flat “boulder paveinelit” which contains abundant algal mats. The river channel in this region disappears into a network of sniall interconnecting flows between the flat boulders. Below this the slope steepens, and the flows coalesce into a few distinct chaiinels which enter a large ponded area called Lake Bull. The final slope from Lake Bull t o  Lake Vanda is steep (gradient 0.0395 m - ni-1) and the streambed comprises large boulders, with crusts and filnra of algae. In addition t o  the four sites shown on Fig. 2 we also exainined algal community structure a t  the seven sites described in SHAWand HEALY

(1980) which form a useful set of reference points down the stream. The complex river morphology on the Onyx is discussed by SHAWand HEALY (1980)and the hydrology by CHI” (1974, 1981). Flows of up to 15 n13s-1 have been recorded but the flow is highly variable from gear t o  year.

3. Methods

3.1. Stream discharges

Discharge in the Onyx River was measured at Vanda weir by the Sew  Zealand Ministry of Works and Development (see C ~ N N 1981). For other streams, discharges were estimated from stream velocities obtained with a pygmy current meter, or, in some reaches where this was not feasible, by using a neutrally buoyant float with appropriate corrections (JOHN1978). In  both eases measurements were made in straight reaches where we had previously obtained cross-sec- tional areas.

3.2.Water and ice samples

Water samples were collected in acid-washed polythene bottles, and ice samples in polythene beakers. The latter were melted upon return t o  the field camps by placing the beakers in trays of warm water. All samples were filtered within a few hours of collection (Whatman GF/C fil- ter  paper). They were kept frozen during storage and the subsequent transport t o  the laboratory in Xew Zealand. All water analyses were carried out on a Technicon TI auto-analysersystem. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) was measured by the  method of DOWSES(1978a). Total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) was measured as DRP  after UV oxidation. Analysis of NH&amp;N was determined by the 

CROOHEand SmrPsoN (1971) method modified for auto-analysis. NOrN was measured by the hydrazine reduction method of DOWNES(1978b). Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were determined after UV oxidation to nitrate. Further details are given in HOWARD-WILLIAMSet al. (1983). Detection limits with these analytical procedures were as  follows: 0.2 mg DRP  m-3, 0.4 mg NO3-” m-3,0.5 mg NH4-Nm-3, 1.0 mg TDP m- j ,  1.0 mg TDNm-3. Suspended sediment samples were filtered onto preweighed precombusted GF/C filters which were then oven dried a t  70 “C and reweighed.

3.3. AlGal saniples

Algal material occurred in *he form of crusts, mat.s and filamentous colonies. Early in t,he sea- son, before first st.ream flows, these were still frozen a,ndattached to the empty stream bed sur- faces. Because of the problems of extreme patchiness of the algal communities and logistic limi-</pre>

tations on tlic numbers of samples we adopted t he  following sampling protocol. I n  a series of selected 3 m reaches of each stream we collected six replicate samples each of 28 cm2 area from patches where we visually estimated t ha t  the  algal community had reached maximum biomass. Three samples were taken from t he  middle and  three from t he  stream edge at each reach. The data  we report are  therefore the maximum levels of biomass found in these streams. Collections were made before first flows (i. e. overwintering biomass) and  again during the middle of the  flow period when the  algae had developed after a few weeks of contact u ith  flowing water. SampIes were stored frozen. Analysis for chlorophyll a was carried out  spectrophotometrically following extraction for 24 h in cold dimethyl sulphoxide (SHOABand  Lruni 1976). Algal samples for taxo- nomic work were preserved with 2 0/6 glutaraldehyde solution.

3.4. Algal conznwnity cover

A t  selected reaches of each stream percent cover of algal material was analysed by  t he  point quadrat method (GREIC-SMITH1964). A t  each site points were taken at  10 cm intervals in a series of transects from bank t o  bank until a t  least 300 points were analysed. At  each point algal presence or absence was noted, as was a substratum size grading In three classes: -4mm, B mm- 25 mm, &gt;25 mm. Confidence limits on these cover estimates were calculated from the  binomial distribution (GREIC-SMITH1964).

December, the period of maximum solar radiation (Fig. 7a) values approached 3.5 kJ om-2 day-* (800 cal om-2 day-1) whereas one month on each side of this period values were only 2.0 kJ cm-2 day-'. Of significance for the stream plant communities in the antarctic suninier environ- ment is the continuous solar radiation over 24 h. Instantaneous records of photo- synthetically active radiation in the wave band 400-700nm from site C2 in the Taylor Valley show values ranging from 200-220 J m-2 5-1 (930-1000 pE m-2 s-1)

Early in the season, when flows are typically low in the small streams, no marked diel pattern was evident (Fig. l l a ) .  During this period stream flows were greatly influenced by slight weather changes a t  any tinie. Later in the season diel periodicity dominated the flow pattern (Fig. 11b) although weather conditions sometimes alter- ed stream temperatures (Fig. 9a). i n  Northern Rookery, Adanis and  Onyx streams, inininiuin flows occurred a t  about 14.0@, and maxirnuin flows a t  18.00-18.0@, shortly after minimum and  maximum water temperatures. C ~ N N (1981) reported on the rapid changes in flow in the Onyx between 24.0ohand 05.0oh which are probably typical for most Victoria Land streams. The streaiii surface iced over in the early hours of niorning (e.g. Fig. 9a), and flows dropped sharply. The ice formed into small “arc terraces” which blocked the stream particularly in  the boulder pavenient area (Fig. 2). With the appearance of the sun from behind the ranges, the ice melted and dispersed. The release of ponded water caused a rapid rise in  discharge which then settled to a steady flow. Aspect and slope are, however, critical in determining the daily discharge pattern. If the slope is too steep, t h i s  damming effect is small and  flows will gradually de- cline as  ice becomes thicker (e.g. Adams stream). The importance of aspect can be seen by a comparison (Fig. 11 )  of the diel variations in the Adams streani (glacier face oriented east to north) with the Whangamata (glacier face oriented west t o  south). Discharge in the Ad a m  began to rise a t  12.00h once the sun had reached its northern zenith. By 16.00h, with the sun in  the west, the flows from t he  glacier face began t o  drop and  by 20.00h the stream began to freeze. I n  contrast the dis- charge from the Whangainata began to rise only at 14.00”when the sun was in the west and  inaxinium discharge was reached at 20.00 with the sun southwest and shining directly on bhe glacier face. After this the sun moved below the tops of the Kukri Hills and  flow stopped as t,he stream froze over.</pre>

4.4. Nutrients in  glaciers and streams

4.4.1. Xutrient levels in glacier ice

Glacier ice is a coniplex mixture of ground-up rock material, wind-blown sand and silts, solid and dissolved salts, and frozen water. The chemistry of the ice re- flects the long term changes in local snow precipitation which includes wind blown particulates, nitrates derived fro111atniospheric oxidative processes, marine-derived salts, and, in the region of Mt Erebns, volcanic inputs. The powdered granular rock material in the glaciers reflects the geologyof the area through which they move. Sanipling of glacier faces to determine the origin of meltwater for the streanis poses problenis asoften the face is clearly made up of ice layers, each with different chemical properties. A large proportion of the runoff originates from the top surface of the glacier, where nutrients i n  local precipitation would constitute a considerable pro- portion of those in the meltwater. Kutrient levels varied between layers of the same glacier (Table 2), and from

N03-K and DRP values in  snow adjacent to the streams were also high. All these sanlples were col- lected before strean1 flows in November 1983, with the exception of the Mt Bird Ice Sheet which was sampled in early Deceniber when the stream flow had just hegun (see Pig. 11a).

Once t he  strean1 flov begins, niitrient I r w l s  are influencecl by levels in tlie source glacier ice, characteristics of t he  streani hed sediments and  any biological inter- actions which niay occur within the  streaiii. In addition, variability in iiiitrient levels is caused hy freeze concentration when a variable proportioil of t he  strwtii water. turns  t o  ice leaving t he  salts  in solutioii. Thus various scales of teniporal aiitl

‘I’hrce types of streanis can be distinguished on t he  basis of upstreatn and doini- stre&lt;inivnliies of inorganic nutrients: (1) inorganic S arid 1’ concentrations are  inore or  less constant with distance down-

Diurnal variability in streani nutrient concentrations is related to the daily freeze- thaw cycles described earlier (section 2.3) and is illustrated by two 24-hour sampling studies on Xortheni Rookery stream. The first study was run early i n  the season (8-9 Uec 1983) a t  low water flows (Fig. 11a )  and the second was later in the season (18-19 Jan  1984) during the more typical higherflows (Fig. 11b). In  theearlyseason, air temperatures ranged from -9 O C  to -4.3 &quot;C, streani O2 levels were constant at around 100 ( 1 , )  saturation and discharges fell over the period from 0.014 1113s-1 t o  -=0.001 mWl.Nutrient levels in the streani were inversely related t o  discharge (Fig. l 4a )  with marked increases at discharges of less than 0.003 1y13s-1. There was a pronounced diel freeze-thaw flow regime in  the late season study (Pig. 1 1  h )  as air temperatures ranged from  -1.5 &quot;C to +3 . 5  O C .  Maximuni flows occur- red in the evening and niininium flows early in the niorning. Mininiuni nutrient concen- trations occurred a t  highest discharges (Fig. 1$b) and concentrations rose rapidly a t  discharges of less than 0.007 i$ s-1. NH,-N concentrations were an order of mag- nitude lower late in the season than they were initially although DRP and A'O,-N

concentrations were similar at both times.</pre>

load also varied with discharge over the die1 cycle in the snialler streanis. For exaniple, in Northern Rookery streani sediment concentration rose two orders of magnitude between low and high flows (Table 9). Discharge in the Onyx on 17/18 Dee 1983 was less variable with time of day than  the sniall streams, and  siruilarly the suspended sediment load was relatively constant. However, turbidity rose sharply with the sudden increase in discharge on 18 December (Table 9).

1.6.Stream algal conimunities

1.6.1.Algal species composition

I n  many of the streanis, particularly clear running waters, the rocks, gravels and sands of the streambed were covered with thick mats and films. The most coninion comniunities were black, iniicilaginous mats, up to 10 nini thick, composed of Nostoc associated with a lesser abundance of Oscillatoriaceae (Phormidiurn spp., Oscillutoria spp., ilrlicrocoleus vaginatus) and pink, grey-green or orange cohesive layers solely of Oscillatoriaceae. Dark red t o  black surface f iliris of QZoeocapscc kuetzingiana were coninion 011the rocks a t  several stream locations and green tufts of Triboneiriu elegans and lhhclercria tectorum occurred in a t  least two streanis. The composition of algal cornniunities coniiiionly changed along the length of each stream. The zonation in the A d a m  Streani was typical (Fig. 15). In steep areas adja- cent to the glacier. Nostoc comm,une and  mats of Oscillatoriaceae were conimon. The latter consisted mostly of 1'. luininoaicm, P. uiicinatuin and some Calothrix spp. However, in stony reaches only the oscillatoriacean niats occurred between the stones. Large stones and boulders had a vertic+alzonation. The tops and upward- facing surfaces were covered with a reddish crust of GZoeocapsa spp. with associated diatoms and some QsciZlutoriu spp. Often a f i l m  of Phorinidium spp. occurred near the base of the rocks and the low light zone under the rocks was inhabited by bright green ribbons of Prnsiola cazophyllu. Long filamentous strands of B. tectorum, up to 5 ('111 in length, were common along stream margins and attached t o  the downstreairi sides of large rocks. Where the stream levelled out on alluvial sands, the algal community comprised diatoms (Hantzschia amnphioxys, NclvicuZa spp.) with some oscillatoria- ceans and  spherical unicellular chlorophytes. The flora of the Fryxell stream has been described in  detail by BOA ~ Y (1982) who recorded a similar structure on the stones t o  that  shown in Fig. 11 .

Stones in the upper reaches of the Fryxell streani had few epilithic algae, but in the middle and lower reaches, periphyton of both mat and crust forms was abundant on rock surfaces and between rocks. Dense black Nostoc spp. mats occurred where the streani reached Lake Fryxell. The streams froin the Commonwealth Glacier commonly had algal mats in their lower reaches and where stream velocities slowed over gravel beds. I n  the Whanga- mata Stream, samples of algal niat were doiiiinated by Phormidium frigidum and Oscillatoriu sanctu. Red coloured epilithic crusts on the rocks comprised Gloeocapsa kuetzingiana and the diatom Hantzschia amphioxys. BROADY(1981) recorded a simi- lar pattern of species from this stream, as well as an abundance of other unidentified pennate diatoms. Of particular interest was the presence of heterocystous blue-green algae (Anabaena spp. and Nodularia hurveyana) which were found nearby in ponds</pre>

4.6.2. Algal cover and  bioniass

Perrent cover of the algal coiiiniunities differed markedly both within and bc- twecri streams. Jn general, maximum cover was recorded in clear streanis, while tke highly turbid flowing waters were devoid of conspicuous growths except in quieter, shallow side-arms or washes. Pig. 16 illustrates this effect in three contrasting stream types: the Onyx, where abundant algal growth occurs only in limited stretches of the strean,, the clear Adains Stream which has an  abundance of algae throughout, arid the highly turbid Whanganiata and Northern Rookery streanis where algal grot5t h  is mi I i i131sl.

Algal cover was negatively correlated ( r =  -0.76, p-0.001) with the proportion of fine sediment in the stream channels (Fig. 17). The effect of the presence of this rrnstahie material was apparent in the middle reaches of the Onyx River where algae were visible only on the edges of the channels where large pebbles and stones occurrcd, arid where this substratuni was not continually shifting.</pre>

A more detailed analysis of one reach of the Onyx River showed that  four distinct algal habitats could be recognised (Table 10). Habitat types 1-3 were areas which were flooded continuously over a diurnal period. The algal cover increased in inverse proportion to the presence of fine sediments as  would be expected from Big. 16. Ha- bitat type 4,although having suitable substrata for algal growth, was inundated only for short periods each day, and  as  a consequence, O/, algal cover was reduced. It was apparent froni our analyses, that  the :/, cover of algae present before the first flows (i.e. the overwintering algal stock)make up a considerable proportion of the niid-summer 0 '  cover. This proportion ranged from 44 O / ;  in the Whangamata streani to a high 73 &quot;;,:in the Fryxell stream. However, a t  two sites (one in the Onyx and  one in  the Whangamata), sediments transported by the streamduring summer smoth- ered algae which had been recorded before flows began and the mid-summer cover was less than that  originally present. The apparent high overwintering stock of algae was investigated further by algal biomass measurements. Chlorophyll a of the periphyton per unit stream surface area ranged from undetect- able in fast flowing stream reaches with unstable sediments to a very high 57 pg cni-2 in slow flowing areas where thick Nos;toc mats had developed (Adams Stream, Fryxell Stream). Undetectable to very low values were recorded in the  Northern Rookery stream and  the Whangamata stream, with a mean (kSE) for 6 sites in each stream of 1.85 ( *0.083) and  0.08 ( f0.02) pg cm-2 respectively. Chlorophyll a values in the Onyx River varied from 12 pg cm-2 in the upper reaches (site 01) to 0.0 Spg cm-2 in some of the niid-stream sections (Fig. 18a). The trend for biomass followed that  of 0/,1 cover with maximal values in the upper and  lower reaches where a stable riverbed occurred. In those sections of the river with unstable sediments in the channel we found t ha t  although biomass was low it was usually higher on the more stable channel banks than in the centre.</pre>

The highest algal biomass occurred in the Adanis stream (Fig. 18b) and the Fryxell stream (Fig. 18c). The samples shown in Fig. 18b for the t,opsite close to the glacier were collected from the main stream channel. However, the area adjacent to the gla- cier was a complex hydrological system of seeps and channels with very varied algal biomass accumulations. The extent of these appeared to increase with decreasing flow  rates and decrease with degree of channelisation of the stream (cf. Table 11). Data froin the Adams and Fryxell streams illustrates the quantitative importance of the overwintering biomass to the final biomass which develops by mid-season. Overwintering chlorophyll a made up between 20 and 1000,; of the values recorded later in t.he season (Fig. 18b, c). I n  the Whangamata stream and parts of the Onyx, biomass decreased through the season due to shifting stream sediments. A t  some locations, very different algal communities and areal biomasses occurred above and below the stream boulders (Fig. 15). I n  the Adams stream, for instance, the reddish film of oscillatoriaceans on the upper surfaces of rocks (Fig. 15) had a relatively low chlorophyll content per unit area (1.5pg cm-2), but contained rich carotenoid pigmentation, presumRbly as  a protection against bright light.

5 .  Discussion

A useful review of high latitude stream ecology has been compiled by HARPER (1981). This exclusively cites Northern Hemisphere examples and points to the lack of data from Antarctica. HARPERconcludes that arctic streams differ from streams elsewhere only by being subjected to  extreme photoyeriods and low rates of input of radiant energy. However, it is evident from  our studies of the streams of southern Victoria,Land that there are several other important differences which, in combination, separate them froni both Northern Hemisphere high latitude streams and temperate streams. I n  brief these features include: (i) the streams are all entirely glacier-fed, rather than snow-fed which has a signifi- cant effect on their hydrology (ii) during the short summer melt period there are marked diurnal changes in water flow (iii) the ice in the stream channels ablates during winter due to  wind erosion leaving a dry, frozen stream bed and an associated freeze-dried epilithon. (iv) most of the streanis flow through catchments with, a t  most, a few small patches of mosses and lichens and with a sparse soil microflora. Where significant bio- logical activity occurs in the catchment it is associated with marine animals (birds, seals) rather than with vegetation. Glacier-fed streams of the arctic zone show characteristics (i) and (ii) (MEIER 1964, WENDLERet al. 1972). Desert watercourses elsewhere show highly irregular flows and often flow through catchments with very little biological activity (c. f. (iv) above). Input of allochthonous material in desert streams is often negligible relative to autochthonous inputs (NAIMAN1976, DANCE1981). STEFFAN(1972) found that gla-</pre>

539 cier-fed streams in Alaska and Lappland were different to snow-fed streams of the area, being characterised by lower nutrient concentrations and lower temperatures. The streams of Victoria Land, therefore share some physical characteristics with Xorthern Hemisphere glacier streams and some with desert streams elsewhere, but the combination of characters (i)-(iv) above, and the special feature (iii) which we have not seen recorded for other streams, set them aside as  a very distinct group of lotic ecosystems. Perhaps the most comparable streams are those of the high Arctic polar deserts briefly referred t o  in BLISSet al. (1984) but for which we have as yet seen no descriptions. They appear to be snow-fed and flow for 7-14 days each year. The annual freezing and ablation of ice t o  the Streambed imposes a particularly harsh set of environmental conditions on the lotic flora and microfauna of Antarctic streams which must sustain several months a t  temperatures to -55 OC . 

i n  STEFFAN’Y(1972) consideration of N .  Hemisphere glacier-fed streams, he  point- ed to their low nutrient status as a special characteristic. Whilst this may he truefor some Antarctic streams, none appear t o  be ultra-oligotrophic, and high nutrient levels are found in two sets of conditions. First, when streams flow through penguin rooke- ries they are enriched with nutrients. Secondly, high nutrient levels are associated with first flows (Table 3, and see WEANDet ul. 1977, CANFIELDand GREEN 1983). This is a transient phenomenon. VINCENTand HOWARD-WILLIAMS( 1986) suggest that this initial high nutrient pulse may be advantageous t o  the stream flora which, like terrestrial desert flora (EICKMEYER1979,1982)rapidly resumes metabolic activity on rehydration. The source of these early flow nutrients has not been clearly established. There are however, three possibilities : 1. Glacier surfaces. Although glacier ice is by no means pure water (Table 2) in- organic N and P concentrations in the ice are generally low. (Organic ?J and P are discussed elsewhere-DowNEs et al. in press.). However, water samples from the ini- tial melting surfaces of the glaciers, collected from dripping icicles, had relatively high N and P contents (Table2). We do not as  yet fully understand thereasonsforthis but salts may be concentrated on glacier surfaces by continuous freeze-thaw cycles, and they may be deposited as  wind-blown particulates froni the adjacent land sur- facesand from the sea. -411the glacier sites studied were within 20 kni of the sea, and with the strong winds which blow in the region we may expect considerable niarine aerosol development, movement and precipitation. Such aerosols will coat the surfaces of the glaciers and accumulate in winter t o  be released with first flows. Visually conspi- cuous quantities of soil and sediments from adjacent land surfaces accuniulate on the glaciers and salts from this material may be largely released or leached during first flows each year. A further source of atmospherically derived high nitrate on these glaciers has been postulated and is believed t o  originate by atmospheric oxi- dation of N2gas, possibly by auroral activity (ZELLERand PARKER1981). 2. Snowdrifts. Snow in drifts in stream channels and on adjacent slopes has higher nutrient levels than glacier ice, and would contribute t o  the first melt. 3. Streambed sediments. These can potentially supply nutrients (Table 4 and see HOEHNet al. 1977), particularly t o  the first flows by three processes: nutrients may be frozen out  and deposited from the previous year’s stream, the ice of which has ablated; nutrients can be generated from soil weathering processes on the dry stream- beds over winter; nutrients may be generated from the oxidation or weathering of algal material from the previous season’s growth. However, streambed sediments are not likely t o  be as  important t o  the early nutrient pulse as  glaciers and snow. Whilst in another study (DOWNESet aE. in press) it has been demonstrated that or- ganic N and P may be derived in some quantity from streambed sources, this is unlike- ly to be the case with inorganic nutrients. For instance, if we multiply the area of

C. HOWARD-WILLIAMSet al. streambed which is covered with water on the first day  of flow by the quantities of nutrients released per unit area (Table4) we can estimate the total released amount by the  streambed. Dividing this by the total discharge over the first, 24h gives anapproxi- illation of the likely rise in concentration of the nutrient due to streambed processes. The values calculated for the Onyx River, for instance, are 1 nig n i - . :  DRP  and 0.6 iiig ni-3 of NO.)-N, negligible amounts compared with the actual concentrations (Table 3, Fig. 13). Very high nutrient levels in the lower reaches of the Norhhern Rookery Stream are  obviously derived from the penguin rookeries, but the high proportion of the oxi- dised form of inorganic N is of interest. Here, we recorded up  t o  80 mg m-3 of ni- trite-N and up to 4 g m-:! of nitrate-N. The soil nitrogen originates from penguin guano, and is mostly in the form of uric acid which decomposes rapidly t o  ammonium (SPIERand COWLING1984) resulting in soil concentrations of 40 mg NH,-N g-1. These ornithogenic soils are therefore very different from most soils elsewhere where organic matter is largely derived from plants. SPEIRand COWLING (1984) speculated that in addition to natural weathering, some of this ammonium could be converted t o  nitrate by nitrifying bacteria. Our data on the high N02-N and N03-N concentra- tions in the streamwaters flowing through these soils would suggest that  nitrifica- tion is an  important process in the summer period here. Nitrification has been recorded from penguin rookery soils a t  subantarctic Marion Island (LINDEBOOM1984). A t  the mean soil temperature of 6O, low rates were found, but in one experiment the  process oxidised as much a s  100nig N ni-2 day-1 when the incubation temperature was raised t o  20 OC ,  a soil temperature he sometimes recorded in the field. Clearly, a t  the Northern Rookery, substrates are not limiting and soil temperatures can rise to 10 O C  making these alkaline soils ideal sites for nitrification for a t  least one or two months each year resulting in high levels of oxidised nitrogen in the stream water. However, it is note- worthy that  this stream, with its high nutrient concentrations, supported no signifi- cant algal growth. In contrast, the Adams stream had fairly low nutrient levels and was biologically very rich. The physical regime of the streams seems t o  be of greater importance than nutrients i n  determining biological activity. Streambed stability and  the amount of suspended sediments which scour the periphyton are apparently the major physical factors affecting algal growth. This conclusion is supported by a correspondence between water clarity and  algal cover: turbid streanis were largely devoid of algae while all clear waters had abundant growth. In a series of artificial substratum growth experiments in these streams there was an  inverse correlation between algal biomass accumulation and maximum suspended sediment load (VIN-

CENT and  HOWARD-WILLIAMS1986). The standing crop which survives from one summer t o  the next usually lies close to the maximum sustainable crop for the whole season. High biomass can apparently only develop by small increments over many years on a stable substratum which lasts from year t o  year. Sediment load was a highly variable component of the Dry Valley streams (Table 7, and see HOEHNet al. 1977). High sediment loads are  a characteristic of Alaskan and  Alpine glacier streams (MEIER1964, COLLINS1983) and are a conspicuous feature of the south temperate New Zealand glacial streams. Diurnal variability in suspended load concentration., has been noted for Alaskan glacial streains (SLATT1972) and is apparently a function of die1 variation in stream flow conditions. The decrease in sediment load with distance downstreani (Table 8)is also a feature of Alaskan glacial streams (MEIER 1964). However, many of the streams we examined had flow rates too low to move considerable quantities of sediment (Table 7)  and  it was these which supported maximum algal gmwth. The algal communities of Victoria Land streams were dominated by the Cyano- phyceae (Tables 10, 11, Fig. 15). BROADY(1982) noted that  this group comprised</pre>

63 0 ,) of the total algal taxa in all antarctic streanis studied up to that tinie. Cyano- phyceans are known to be highly resistant to freezing stresses (DUBOISand KAWTSKA 1983) which could confer an advantage over other groups of algae. The diatom flora of the streams is certainly impoverished relative to that in the benthos of the adjacent dry valley lakes where freezing would not occur, perhaps, because this group is not as physiologically resistant to freezing as  the Cyanophyceae. A further advantage which may be conferred on the heterocystous Fiu’,-fixingCyanophyceans is the low ?;/P ratio of the Victoria Land streamwaters. Inorganic N/P ratios of only 2-3 occurred in all streams except the Onyx (seedata in Table 5 ) . The Nostoc cowmune colonies we examined had abundant heterocysts, and N-fixing species of Anabaena and Nodularia were recorded from ponded portions of streams in the Taylor Valley (Fig. 12). ALLXUTTet d.(1981) detected acetylene reduction (although rates were low) in algal mats containing heterocystous Cyanophyceae in shallow waters on the edges of the lakes of this region. Nitrogen fixation reniains an unquantified coniponent of the southern Victoria Land flowing water environments. Despite low temperatures and a brief season of streamflow, antarctic streanis can support an abundant algal epilithon. They contain chlorophyll u levels coinparable to the highest values reported froni streams of the temperate zone (cf. LOCK1981), and maintain a viable overwintering biomass that coniprises a large percentage of the late season streambed cover. These coniniunities live in a structured, linear ecosysteni that has a well-defined point source of water and dissolved materials (the glacier), longitudinal gradients of sediment load and nutrients, but minimal exchanges of inass and  energy with the surrounding catchment through which it flows.

6. Summary

Running waters originating from glacial melt are a seasonal feature of Antarctica and are especially prevalent in the vicinity of McMurdo Sound. We have sampled 24 of these waters and have conducted detailed studies on five contrasting streanis. Streaniwater temperatures showed a marked diel variability (freezing to 11 “C) which was sensitive to ambient air teniperatures and insolation. Discharges ranged froni 0.01 n1.Js-1 in small streams t o  15 1113 s-1 in the Onyx River and varied a t  diel and weekly time scales although annual flow periods were short (ca. 6 weeks). We found that aspect and slope were major determinants in the flow regimes of these streams;the tinie of dayof niaxinium dischargedepended on theorientationof thesource glacier relative to the sun. Xutrients (dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus compounds) were analysed in glaciers, and streamwaters on a diel and seasonal basis. Early nieltwaters had 10-20 times higher levels of dissolved N and P than those later in the season. There was considerable variability in nutrient concentrations between streams a t  rnaxiinuin discharge (e.g. dissolved reactive phosphorus ranged froni -= 1 mg m-J in Fryxell Stream t o  =-lo0nig ni-J in h’orthern Rookery Stream) within streams on a diel basis and within streams with distance froin a glacier to the streain outflow. Variability was due to: the presence of dense algal mats which removed nutrients, penguin rookeries which added nutrients and different concentrations in the source glaciers. The suspended sediment content of the stream waters was shown to vary over four orders of magnitude with deep fast flowing streams exhibiting niaxiniuin sediuient loads (5-600g in-:!). Die1 changes in sediment loads were ohserved and these were directly related to discharge. Algal comniunities were made up predominantly of blue-green algae ( P h o r n ~ i d i ~ c , </pre>

Oscillutoria, Nostoc, Gloeocapsa). Other important genera including the green algae Binuclearia and Prasiola were the tribophyte Tribonema, and  t)he pennate diatoms Hantzschia and Naviculu. Water flow rates and substrate type influenced species com- position and bioiiiass. Biomass ranged from undetectable in shifting sands to values in excess of 25 pg chl a cni-2 in stable mat communities. Physical factors (turbidity, flow, sediment type) were of greater importance than nutrients in determining algal standing crop.
