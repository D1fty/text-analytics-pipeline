Abstract

Distribution patternsarepresentedfor selectedaquaticalgae,and terrestrial algae,mossesand lichens, at three large, coastal ice-freeregionson Ross Island. Each region is unique in certain aspectsof its vegetation.The variation in areal and quantitativeoccurrenceof different componentsof the vegetation in diverseponds and streams,and over exposedground surfaces,is related to the levelsof marine salts in the environment,fertilisation by birds, water availability, substratumtype and degreeof exposure.A comparisonis madewith other antarctic,coastal,ice-freeregionswheresimilar broadscalepatternshave beenrecognised.

Introduction

Thepurposeof this investigationwas to compare broadscalepatterns in the distribution of macro- scopic and selectedmicroscopic vegetation at three large,coastal,ice-freeregionsin the vicinity of CapeBird, C. Royds and C. Crazier on Ross Island. The survey included terrestrial algae, lichens and mosses,and aquatic algaein ponds and streams. Much of the terrestrial vegetation could be termed ‘semi-aquatic’ as it was usually flushedwith percolationsof meltwaterfor periods duringsummer.No attempt wasmadeto compile completespecieslists. Similar datahasbeencollectedat other ice-free regionsin the Continental Antarctic Zone (sensu Pickard &amp; Seppelt, 1984), for instance the Vestfold Hills (68” 35’ S, 77” 58’ E; Broady, 1986;Pickard, 1986;Seppelt,1986a,b), Mawson Rock (67” 26’ S, 62” 53’ E; Seppelt &amp; Ashton, 1978; Broady, 1982a) and East Ongul Island

(69” S, 39” 30’ E; Matsuda, 1968; Karasawa &amp; Fukushima, 1977; Nakanishi, 1977).As in the presentstudy,the influenceof salt on thedistribu- tion of vegetation was noted to be marked, together with effects due to water and nutrient availability. On Ross Island there are distinct contrasts in the environment and vegetation at each ice-freeregionwhich allows further insight into the factors controlling distribution. The broadscale, descriptive data also provides a foundation, and direction, for the developmentof moredetailedecologicaland physiologicalinves- tigations. Botanical investigationshave beenmade pre- viously at the three study areas.Algae at Cape Royds were first described by West &amp; West ( 191l), andFukushima( 1964)reportedfurther on the diatoms. Goldman et al. (1972) made brief observationson pond and lake algaeand Hohn- Hansen (1964) cultured algae from ponds and soils. Thenutrient physiologyof algaein pondsat</pre>

C. Bird and C. Royds was studiedby Vincent &amp; Vincent (1982), and Howard-Williams et al. (1986)examinedthecharacteristicsof a streamat C. Bird. Observationson algaein four ponds at C. Bird wereprovidedby Zaneweld(1969)and in a singlepond by Spurr(1975).Mosseshavebeen describedfrom Ross Island (Greene,1967)and Dodge (1973) included lichen records from C. Crozier and C. Royds. Longton (1973)described terrestrialplant communitiesat C. Royds and C. Bird but did not investigatebroad-scaledistribu- tion patterns.

Salts of marineorigin havebeenshown to be quantita- tively most important in the McMurdo region, with lesseninginfluenceswith increasingelevation and distance inland (Keys &amp; Williams, 1981). Marine saltsarealsotransferredto land by birds, in their faecesandexcretions.This effectwould be most marked in penguinrookeries.

Methods

Observationsweremadeover oneperiod of three to four weeksat eachregionduring the summers of 1982-83and 1984-85.Extensive notes were made describingthe location and abundanceof vegetationduring traverseson foot over the large majority of each region. Traverse routes were varied in order to cover as wide an area as possible. Locations were plotted on large scale maps. These records were transformed into

This has inevitablyresultedin somelossof resolution,par- ticularly at boundariesof vegetationchange,but is adequatefor demonstrating broadscale pat- terns. At C. Roydsand C. Crozier theconductivityof water in streamsand pondswas measuredusing a Model 33 S-C-T meter (Yellow Springs Instu- ment Co.) and at C. Bird salinity was assessedby taste. Samplesof algaewere removedfor micro- scopic examinationusing light microscopy.

Results and discussion

Algae, lichensandmosseswere found at all three regionsin a wide rangeof aquaticand terrestrial habitats. However, the frequencyof occurrence and abundanceof different communities con- trastedmarkedlyfrom regionto region.Thebroad distribution patterns in ponds and streams and over exposedground are described below, to- getherwith discussionof controlling factors and resultsof studieselsewhere.Algaeincludedin this account are those forming macroscopicgrowths visible to the unaided eye and specieswhich, although not growing in such abundance,are characteristicof certainhabitats.A systematiclist of thesealgaeis presentedin Table 1togetherwith a summary of the habitats in which they were found.

Severalwerevisitedby penguinsand in particular by skuasand receivedsomenutrient enrichment from these sources. Their areas varied widely from 1 to 4000m*. All wereshallowwith a maxi- mum depth of &lt; 2 m. Somedried out during the studyperiod.Pondsin areasaffectedby sea-spray werepredominantly of high conductivity (300 to &gt; 2 000m Sm- ‘) and of saline taste, whereas outside these areas the majority were of lower conductivity (50-300 m Sm- ‘) andof freshtaste (Fig. 7). Small ponds formed along the shorelinedue to the melting of sea-ice which had become groundedon sandybeaches(Figs. 10-12). These ‘shorelineponds’ were frequent in the northern half of C. Bird, with about 25 in total, infrequent at C. Royds, 5 in total, and nonewere observed at C. Crozier. Strongwinds blow a layer of dark sandover the groundedice.

Theseponds weregenerallybrackish to saline. Within and directly adjacent to the nesting

areasof penguins(Fig. 3) therewereturbid, highly nutrient andorganicallyenrichedponds (Fig. 13). The catchmentsof these‘rookeryponds’, and the ponds themselves,contained substantial guano depositsand scatteredbird carcasses.They num- bered9, 1 and 4 at C. Bird, Royds and Crozier respectively.All were salinewith conductivities &gt;300m Sm-*. Mineral sediments(‘cryoconite’) melting into glacier ice form ‘cryoconite ponds’ (Wharton

et al., 1985).These were found only in the ice borderingthenorth-easternedgeof C. Bird. Here the hard ice surfacewas darkenedby substantial mineral depositswhichhad meltedinto the iceon flat areas (Fig. 14). The ponds were generally cylindrical, 20-40 cm diameter and 20-30 cm deep,althoughoccasionallythey attained5 m* in surfacearea.Thewaterswereof low conductivity, lessthan 50m Sm- ‘. Their absenceat C. Royds and C. Crozier was probably due to the sloping topography of most ice-fields and the relatively clean ice surfaces.

Algal flora

The majority of ‘typical ponds’ containedbenthic felts dominated by Phormidium, Lyngbya and

Uscillatoria irrespectiveof conductivityand salini- ty (Fig. 15). In contrast, macroscopicgrowthsof

Nostocsp.wereencounteredalmost solelyoutside saline areasand were notably infrequent at C. Bird (Fig. 15).Gloeocapsa kuetzingiiana was a fre- quent microscopic component within ‘typical ponds’ of low conductivity at C. Royds and C. Crozier alone(Fig. 15). However, it had a more restricteddistribution at C. Royds where,except for a westerncoastal record, it was mostly con- fined to an easternzone at the highest altitudes surveyed.In theseponds it dominated the rela- tively thin crustswhich coveredstonesandgravel. Other algaepossesseddistinct preferencesfor watersof highconductivityandwereeitherabsent or rarely found at C. Crozier. For instance in saline‘typical ponds’, visibly yellow-greenphyto- plankton populationsof cf. Chroomonas lacustris

often developed(Fig. 16). Thesealso frequently contained rich green growths of Ulothrix sp. (Fig. 16). This alga was frequent in ‘shoreline ponds’ associatedwith green benthic films of

Chlamydomonas cf. subcaudata (Fig. 17) but the latter was infrequentin saline ‘typical ponds’. A secondspeciesof Chlamydomonas, C. cf. snowiae,

characterisedthe saline,nutrient-enriched‘rook- ery ponds’ where dense unialgal populations developed(Fig. 17). It was not encounteredin other habitats. Two saline ‘typical ponds’ at C. Royds contained small populations of the halo- phileBrachiomonas cf. submarina (Fig. 16).

Diatoms were often abundantin salineponds but infrequent elsewhere (Fig. 18). This is apparent in their widespreaddistribution at C. Bird, their almost total restriction to sea-spray affectedareasat C. Royds and their rarity at C. Crozier. Three species were characteristic of saline ‘typical ponds’; Navicula shackletoni, Tropidoneis laevissima and Melosira setosa. T. laevissima and N. qptocephala dominated brown benthic films of diatoms in several‘shore- lineponds’.N. muticopsis displayeda wider range

of salinity tolerance being found at low abun- dance in ‘cryoconite ponds’ aswell as in ‘typical ponds’.

Pinnularia cymatopleura occurred solely in ‘cryoconiteponds’ at C. Bird (Fig. 18)and not in waters of similarly low conductivity in ‘typical ponds’. ‘Cryoconite ponds’ alsocontainedOscil- latoriaceaeandunidentifiedchlorococcaleanand chaetophoralean algae (Chlorophyta) at low abundance. The abundance of Oscillatoriaceae and diatoms in lakes and ponds on Ross Island has beenwell known sincereports by West &amp; West (1911). Similar communities to those described above have been found elsewhere.In northern Victoria Land there were ‘shoreline ponds’ containing Chlamydomonas cf. subcaudata and

Ulothrix sp., a ‘rookery pond’ with C. cf. snowiae,

and Nostoc sp. as a frequent associate with Oscillatoriaceae in low conductivity ‘typical ponds’ (Broady, 1987).At Mawson Rock, ponds in salineareaswereoften dominatedby diatoms, but alsocontainedrich growthsof greenfilaments resemblingthe Ulothrix sp. of this study(= Uros-

pora sp., Broady, 1982). The diatom flora of antarctic ponds has been shown to vary markedly with differencesin water chemistry. Field studies by Fukushima (1961, 1964,1967)andco-workers(Karasawa&amp; Fuku- shima, 1977)showedTropidoneis laevissima, Navi- cula cryptocephala and N. mutikopsis to occur in salineponds but that the latter preferedmilder salinities. Theseobservationswere confirmed in culture for T. laevissima and N. muticopsis by Watanuki and Ohno (1976) and Watanuki (1979). It is interestingto note that the first antarctic recordofMelosira setosa wasof marinespecimens from the vicinity of the South Orkney Islands (Frenguelli, 1943).In northern Victoria Land it has beenfound in salinecoastal pools (Broady, 1987). Although regardingPinnularia cymatopleura as a ‘freshwater’ alga, Fukushima (1964, 1967) found specimens in ‘typical ponds’ of high chlorinity at C. Royds and C. Evans. In northern Victoria Land (Broady 1987) records are from freshwater‘typical ponds’ as well as ‘cryoconite ponds’. It is oneof themost abundantnon-marine diatoms in the multitude of ponds on the Mc- Murdo Ice Shelf (Kellogg &amp; Kellogg, 1987). Saline ponds and lakes in the vicinity of Lutzow-Holm Bay (Watanuki &amp; Fukushima, 1978))andat theVestfoldHills (Wright &amp; Burton, 1981) contain substantial populations of Duna- liella sp. but this wasnot observedin similar habi- tats on Ross Island.

Snow algae

Greensnowoccurredat C. Royds andC. Crozier (Fig. 17). All locations were close to the coast wheretherewassubstantialsnowmelt in progress and fertilization by birds. Meltwater from the drifts was always of low conductivity (3-46 m Sm- ‘). The absenceof snow algaeat C. Bird is surprisingbut may be related to the generallack of large snowdrifts, persisting throughout sum- mer, in areastraversedby penguins. At C. Royds the algaeformed small patchesin snow on the coastal ice-foot, adjacent to the penguinrookery.Also, anisolatedpatchoccurred further south, downslope from an accumulation of feathers and guano deposited by moulting penguins.C. Crozier had much more extensive areascovering more than 4 ha adjacent to the penguin rookeries and skua colonies (Figs. 19-20). All samplesweredominatedby an unidentified species of Chlamydomonas, asso- ciated with occasional Ulothrix - like filaments and diatoms. There is only a singleprevious note of snow algaein the Ross Searegions,on PossessionIs. in northern Victoria Land (Koob, 1966). The occurrenceson Ross Is. are the furthest southon record.Thegrowthof snow algaein theproximity of nesting birds has been noted by Akiyama (1979)and the requirementfor melting snow has been recognised, e.g. Llano (1962). Extensive areas similar to those at C. Crozier have been remarkedon only oncebeforein the Continental Antarctic Zone, by Llano (1962)who saw ‘many acres’ of red snow on the Wilkes Land coast.</pre>

During summer,meltwater eitherpercolatesover the surfaceof wide areasof groundor flows within well-definedchannels.Here a stream is regarded as the latter flow pattern. Streams are a major habitat for algaeat C. Bird where thereis a total lengthof approximately48 km (Fig. 21A), but are of relativelyminor importanceat C. RoydsandC. Crozier wherethey flow over only 8 and 4 km of ice-freeground respectively. Streamsvary greatly in physico-chemicaland biological features.Notable differencesoccur in duration, volume and speedof flow, the loading of suspensoidsand in water salinity. The abun- dance and type of vegetationvaries from stream to stream and along the lengths of individual streams.Thepatternsfound in streamsat C. Bird were mapped in somedetail (Fig. 21B). Macroscopically visible vegetationwas absent from 9 of the total 31 streams(Fig. 21A). These usually had rapid, relatively high volume peak flows, mostly derivedfrom glacierice rather than snowdrifts. They flowed over steepground and contained an abundanceof suspensoidswhich made the water turbid. Thin greenepilithic crustswerefoundon down- stream faces of rocks and boulders and on the lower surfacesof largestones.Streamscontaining this typeof growth alone,e.g.2,3 (Fig. 22) 22 and 25, were similar to those in which no vegetation was observed. Where crusts were found in streamswhich also contained other algae, they weredominant whereflow ratesweretoo greatfor establishmentof the other algae.The crustswere dominated by cf. Desmococcus and Phormidium fragile.

Streams with a relatively slow, clear, peak water flow usually contained extensivereddish- brown felts, dominatedby Oscillatoriaceaewhich coveredthe fines, gravel and small stonesof the streambed. The most abundant felts were in streams 5, 17 and 18 and in the snowdrift-fed tributaries of stream7. In other streamsthe felts were often sparse,thin and an indistinct grey. Rich greenepilithic filaments of Ulothrix sp. were dominant in some fast and gently flowing

streams.They were encounteredin most abun- dancein brackishto salinewaters,e.g.streams23 and 24 at C. Bird and some small flows in the sea-spray-sweptareas at C. Royds (Fig. 23). However, at C. Bird thefilamentswerealsoabun-

dam in streamscontainingfreshwater at the time of sampling, e.g. streams 17 and 19. They were not observedat C. Crozier. Green ribbon-like plants of Prusiola calophyZZa

were occasionally found attached to rocks and stonesin fresh-waterstreams.However, this alga wasmost frequentin unchanneledmelt flusheson saturatedground, as were P. c&amp;pa and Nostoc

commune(seebelow). There are distinct contrasts between the dominant algaein C. Bird streamsand thosede- scribed elsewhere.Although Ulothrix spp. were recordedby Hirano (1979)from a streamrunning into Lutzow-Hohn Bay, the speciesdiffer from thepresentspecimensandwerenot notedto form luxuriant growths.Also, no specimensof theRoss Is. UZothrix sp. haveeitherbeenfound in the ice- free valleys of southernVictoria Land (Broady, 1982b; Howard-Williams &amp; Vincent, 1986; Howard-Williams et al., 1986)or at Edmondson Point, northernVictoria Land (Broady, 1987).In thoseregions,rich growthsof greenfilaments and ribbons comprise Binuclearia tectorum, Prasiola calophyllu and Tribonema elegans. The former two speciesare rare in Ross Island streamsand the latterhasnot beenrecorded.Additionally, species of Gloeocupsa and Nostoc have beencommonly found in other areasbut are rare in streamsat C. Bird. Oscillatoriacean felts are ubiquitous. The major factor influencing thesecontrasts is con- sidered to be the generallymore salineC. Bird environment. Culture studies of the dominant taxa would help test this hypothesis. At Signy Island, in maritime Antarctica, the stream flora (Hawes, 1988)contrasts markedly with that known from the Continental Zone, although oscillatoriacean felts are common in both. the most torrential streams are similar in containing sparseepilithic algae,however,these comprise solelydiatoms. Additionally, the domi- nant filamentous chlorophytes are species of

Mougeotia, Zygnema and a Klebsormidium-like

alga. Despite these obvious contrasts, more re- vealingcomparisonsof streamfloras will haveto await the improvement of our taxonomic know- ledgeand the investigationof flowing waters in other regions.

Algae on exposed ground

Rock substrata

Epilithic algaewereencounteredwherethin films of meltwater irrigated rock surfaces. Small growthsnumbered3,1 and5 at CapeBird, Royds and Crozier respectively.At the fast of these, Oscillatoriaceaeand Ulothrix sp. dominated the community, in contrastto Gloeocapsa spp.,Nostoc

sp. and Scytonema sp. in salt-freeareas in the latter two regions. Chasmoendolithicalgaewere present only in granitic, glacial erratic boulders. The predomi- nant dark-colouredlavaswereunsuitablefor their development.Sixteenexampleswerefound at C. Bird and just 2 at C. Crozier. No suitable boulders were present at C. Royds. Both green and blue-greengrowths occurred below thin flakesof rock, the former dominatedby cf. Cocco-

botrys sp. andPrusiococcus calcarius and the latter by Chroococcidiopsis sp. Sublithic (hypolithic) algaeforming crusts on the undersurfacesof translucent stoneslying on the soil were infrequent at C. Bird and absent from C. Royds and Crozier. Six quartz stones supportedgreenand blue-greencrusts. Chroococ- cidiopsis sp., Phormidium sp. and Coccobotrys sp. weredominant. Comparedwith other regions,lithic algaewere rare due to lack of suitable substrata. Epilithic communitieswerelimited by the generalabsence of irrigated rock surfaces. At Mawson Rock (Broady, 1982a)and the Vestfold Hills (Broady, 1981a),32 and 27 crusts of cyanophytes,domi- nated by Gloeocapsa spp. were restricted to salt- free areas.At the former region, meltwater- irri- gated coastal rocks in salt-affectedzones sup- ported rich growths of Ulothrix sp. (= Urospora

sp.,Broady, 1982a)similar to thespeciesfound in salineponds on Ross Island. Endoliths arewidespreadwherethegeologyof the country rocks is suitable, for instance in the southernVictoria Land dry valleys(Friedmann&amp; Ocampo-Friedmann, 1984), the Vestfold Hills and Mawson Rock (Broady, 1981b).Similarly, it is only the paucity of translucent stoneswhich restricts sublithic growths.

Particulate substrata

Soils are raw, mineral fines (lithosols) and orni- thogenic soils with high guanocontent (Ugolini, 1970).Large areasof ground, particularly at C. Crozier, arecoveredby gravel and stones.Water availability at the surfacevaries greatly. At the maximum, melt water percolatesover wide areas of ground, especiallywherecoveredby relatively poorly drained lithosols, and at the minimum moisture comes from the melt of occasional snowfall and snowdrift. Surfaces covered by gravel and stones are usually well-drained and relatively dry as water rapidly percolatesdown through the profile.

Distribution of Cyanophyta

Oscillatoriaceanfelts and macroscopic colonies of Nostoc commune(Fig. 24) weremost abundant on poorly drained lithosols downslope from melting snowdrifts. Suchgroundwasmost exten- siveat C. Bird, where felt coverwas almost con- tinuousover areasup to 500m’, and in thecentral region of C. Royds coinciding with the terraced moraines recognisedby Debenham (1923). The paucity of thesealgaeat C. Crozier is related to

89

the extensiveoccurrenceof well-drainedsurfaces despite there being numerous large melting snowfields. Similar to the ponds (Fig. 15),Nostoc was al- most absent from salineareaswhereasoscilla- toriacean felts were present. This was most apparentat C. Bird where all but one record of N. communewas in the northern half. Oscillatoriaceae and N. commune are well-

known throughout the Antarctic Region on irri- gated soils. Effects on N. commune similar to thoserecordedon RossIsland havebeennotedat Mawson Rock (Broady, 1982a)and the Vestfold Hills (Broady, 1986). At the latter region it occurred within the salt-affected zone only downslopefrom large melting snowdrifts where leachingby snowmelt probably removedrestric- tively high salt concentrations.This could also explain the southernrecord at C. Bird.

Distribution of Prasiola species

Two speciesof Prasiola exhibiteddistinctly differ- ent distribution patterns (Fig. 25). Green foliose thalli of the nitrophilous P. crispa were common on water-saturatedground in the vicinity of bird colonies.In contrast,P. calophylla was intolerant of suchhigh nutrient and salt levelsandwas also excluded from areas receiving windblown sea- spray.The relativelylow frequencyof occurrence

          <pre id="s14v1">90 at C. Bird is probably due to the generallyhigher salt levelsover the region.

The ribbon-like thalli of P. calophylla were generallyl-4 cm long and attachedby a holdfast to small stonesand rocks in water seepage.The plants were often found immediately downslope from thedownhill edgesof snowfieldswheremelt- waterpercolatedbetweenstones.Frequentlythey werenot visibleon upper stonesurfacesbut were revealedwhen the top layer of stoneswas over- turned exposingthe algaeattachedto their lower sidesand undersurfaces.

P. crispa has beenrecognisedas an important antarcticalgain nutrient-enriched,moist habitats sincetheearliestdaysof collection(West &amp; West, 1911) and it is no surprise to find it localised around bird colonies on Ross Is. However,

P. calophylZa is much more poorly known althoughrecent data show it to be widespreadin southernVictoria Land (Broady, 1982b,1987and unpublished records). There it often grows luxuriantly in channelledstreamsbut is alsofound amongstboulders,stonesandgravelwherelesser percolationsflow over and through the substra- tum. The latter growth pattern was predominant on Ross Is, dueto the few channelledwater flows at C. Royds and Crozier.

Crusts of green algae

Green algal crusts coated the surfacesof soils, gravelandstonesat all threeareasbut wereparti- cularly abundant at C. Crozier (Fig. 26). There they weremostly confined to the northernhalf of the region outside the perimeter of the penguin rookery.Theywereoften foundencrustingstones below the ground surface,in a pattern similar to

P. calophyla. However, directly adjacent to the meltingedgesof snowfields,whereawater supply was readily available,therewere abundantpow- dery growths over exposedupper surfaces.The identity of the dominant algain thesecrustscan- not be confidently determined.Although closely resemblingthe sarcinoidPrasiococcus calcarius, it is possible that growth forms and life-stagesof

Prasiola crispa and P. calophylla have a very similar morphology. The crusts were dominated lessfrequentlyby cf. Coccobotrys sp. At C. Royds,

similar crustscomprisingcf. P. calcarius werepre- dominantly encounteredin areasreceivingwind- blown sea-spray.At C. Bird greencrusts were infrequent, and only on small areas of moist, mineral fines close to penguincolonies, but not where large quantitiesof guanowere deposited. The flora of thesewasmorediverseand although dominatedby cf. P. calcarius and Klebsonnidium

sp. also contained over 20 species of other microalgae. The ecologyof P. calcarius in Antarctica has beendiscussedpreviouslyin somedetail (Broady, 1983).In particular, the preferencefor salty envi- ronmentswas emphasized.It is possiblethat the specimensobservedin salt-affectedareasat C. Bird and C. Royds, and around the peripheryof the penguincolony at C. Crozier, are this alga. However, in such habitats, they would also be exposed to nutrient-enrichmentfrom birds and could be a growth form of the nitrophilous

P. crispa. Similarly, themore southerlyrecordsin the relativelysalt-freeareasof C. Crozier overlap the distribution of P. calophyZZa(Fig. 16)and they could be a growth form of that alga. This con- fusion will be resolvedonly by critical studieson unialgal culturesof isolatesof thesealgae.

Candelariella antarctica and speciesof Buellia, Caloplaca, Candelaria, Lecanora and Xanthoria.

Foliose lichens were representedby Umbilicaria aprina and fruticose by Usnea antarctica.

At C. Bird, lichenswere extremelyrare, being restrictedto sparsegrowthsof crustoseCaloplaca darbishirei. This is possibly a response to the generallyhigh levelsof salt thought to occur over the region as a whole, even in the relatively pro- tectednorthernhalf. In contrast crustosespecies werewidespreadand abundant at C. Royds and C. Crozier. At C. Royds they were absent from areasreceivingmaximum quantitiesof sea-spray, but outsidetheseregionsgreatestabundancewas at low altitudesclose to the coast wherenutrient input from skuasoccurred.Similarly at C. Crozier maximum abundancewas around the periphery of the penguinrookery, especiallywherenesting skauswerecommon. Theywereabsentwithin the rookery where salt levels and mechanical dis- turbancewere high. At higher altitudes, in both regions,most occurrenceswereof small, sparsely scatteredBuellia and Caloplaca. A contrasting distribution was clearly seenwith the folioseand fruticose species.

Usnea antarctica and Umbilicaria aprina were absentfrom C. Bird and at C. Royds and Crozier werepresentin a muchmore restrictedareathan crustosespecies.At C. Royds both occurredin a

91 zone stretching from the northernmost coastal regionsback in a southeasterlydirection up onto the high slopesabove the 150m contour. At C. Crozier U. antarctica was found in a southeastern zone stretchingfrom the coastal cliffs to a maxi- mum altitudeof about 300m. U. aprina wasmore restrictedandoccurredin the southernmostpart of the Usnea rangeexceptfor one isolatedrecord to the north. Thesetwo speciesappearedto be restricted to areasof minimum salt levels and nutrient input, although northern occurrences at C. Royds occurredin thevicinity of nestingskuas.Observa- tionsmade followingperiodsof strongwinds with snowdrifting indicated that it was in theseareas that maximum accumulation of drift occurred, mostly on the downwind sides of boulders and knolls. It was in such microsites that the lichens were usually encountered. Subsequent melt would enhancemoisture availability and could leach salts and nutrients from the substrata. The inability of most lichens to establish in salt-laden environmentshas been described at Mawson Rock (Seppelt &amp; Ashton, 1978) and VestfoldHills (Seppelt,1986a;Pickard, 1986).At both regions,strong winds blow salt spray over land areasdownwind from open sea and saline lakesin a patternsimilar to that at C. Royds. The same factor could be responsible for the im- poverishmentof lichen communitieson East and West Ongul Is. compared with richer commu- nities on rock areasalong the neighbouringcoast (Nakanishi, 1977). The latter receive salt-free katabaticwinds straightoff the continent. Similar winds also probably occur at Birthday Ridge, northern Victoria Land, where Kappen (1985a) encounteredlichensboth inland and at thecoast. At the VestfoldHills, the distribution of differ- ent lichen species varies markedly (Seppelt, 1986a).Of particular note in the presentcontext is the greatlyrestricted occurrenceof Usnea an- tarctica comparedwith most crustosespecies,and especiallyBuellia ftigida. In more detailed ana- lyses(Pickard &amp; Seppelt, 1984;Pickard, 1986),a set of lichens including U. antarctica has been recognisedasoccurringnear the ice-sheetandon inland margins of small coastal rock outcrops.</pre>

This pattern is consideredto be a responseto highermoistureavailability andconsiderablyless wind-blow salt, as has beensuggestedabovefor the relativelynarrow distribution of U. antarctica

at RossIs. This relationshipmight alsobetrue for

U. subhurea which is absent from the Ongul Islands but present on nearby coastal ice-free areas (Nakanishi, 1977).Additionally, Kappen (1985)describedU. subhurea asmoreprominent in the vegetationfurther inland at Birthday Ridge, northern Victoria Land. He also suggested nutrient enrichmentfrom birds to explainricher coastal communities. Nakanishi (1977) noted a similar responseat coastal Skarvsnesin Lutzow- Holm Bay.

Mosses

Bryum argenteum, B. antarcticum and Sarconeu- rum glaciale havebeenrecordedfrom Ross Is. by Longton (1973). No attempt was made to dis- tinguish the separatespeciesduring this study. Similar to crustose lichens, mosses were into- lerant of high salt levelsin sea-sprayswept areas and penguinrookeries(Fig. 28). However, at C. Bird they wereclearlymore widespreadthan the lichens.Herethegreatestabundance,and83% of all stands,was in the areastretching3 km south from Northern Rookery. Standsoccurredas iso- lated cushions to confluent carpets up to lo-20 m2. Generally they wereon water-flushed substrata, particularly the relatively poorly drained mineral lines (Fig. 29). Sites were pro- tected from strong winds and were in positions more likely to be suppliedwith melt percolating from snowdrifts as theyoccurredon moreor less north-facing slopes, in depressionsand gullies, and on ground downwind of hummocks and knolls. At C. Royds no standsexcededa few square meters in extent and most occurrenceswere of one or a few, small scatteredcushions. 56% of records, and maximum abundance,occurredbe- low 50m altitude. Above this height moss was much sparser,especiallyin the southernhalf of the region which is more exposedto the strong south-easterlywinds than are the west to north- west facing slopesin the north. 69% of stands were in this northern area. At C. Crozier, mosseswere sparseand widely scattered.Most recordswereof singleor a small number of adjacent cushions each less than 10cm2in diameter.More abundantgrowthswere found only on north to northeast-facingslopesin the northernpart of the regionwhere 71% of all standswerefound.

Isolated cushionswerepresentup to amaximum elevation of 915m but most were found below 300m. Mosses areabsentfrom the most heavily salt- affected areas at the Vestfold Hills (Seppelt, 1986b; Pickard, 1986) and Mawson Rock (Seppelt&amp; Ashton, 1978).This alsoappearsto be the caseat East Ongul Island althoughthis is not stated by Matsuda (1968). The occurrence of mossesin the west and north-west of the island correlateswith the presenceof ponds of lowest chlorinity. This compares with an absenceof mossesand presenceof pondsof generallyhigher chlorinity to the east and south (Karasawa &amp; Fukushima, 1977). There are indications that mosses are more tolerant of salt than lichens.At theVestfoldHills, Pickard (1986) distinguished certain areas as beingbasicallyoccupiedby only mosses,but con- sidered that ‘this is probably an artefact of collectingas a well-collectedgrid rarely contains only mosses’.Also, he noted with ‘surprise’ that gridswith ‘mossesonly’ co-occurredsignificantly with those containing saline lakes. At C. Bird mossesoccurredwidely outsidethe veryconfined distribution of lichenspossiblydue to the greater tolerance of mosses to the relatively high salt levels which occur throughout this region. Additionally, at East Ongul Island, mossesare frequent but the lichen flora is extremely poor (Nakanishi, 1977),possibly for the samereason.

Conclusions

It is apparentthat major differencesbetweenthe floras of different areaswithin individual ice-free regionson Ross Island, and betweenthe regions themselves,arestrongly influencedby the degree to which they are subjected to saline aerosols. Similar situationshave beenrecognisedin more northern, coastal continental, ice-freeregionsof East Antarctica, particularly at the VestfoldHills (e.g. Pickard, 1986) and Mawson Rock (e.g. Seppelt &amp; Ashton, 1978). However, such broadscalepatterns have not beendescribedin maritime Antarctica. There, the greater precipi- tation and subsequentlygreatervolumes of fresh meltwater probably prevent the accumulationof such high levelsof salt in soils and ponds. This study has describeddistribution patterns at low resolution and those mostly of the domi- nant algaeand broad groupingsof lichens and mosses. Also, the environmental information is mostly subjective.The resultsserveasa base-line for more detailedstudieswith a greaterquantita- tive componentutilising statistical approachesto community analysis.In particular,the structureof algal communitiesin ponds and streamsneedsto be relatedto detaileddataon waterchemistryand temporal changesshouldbe taken into account. It is probable that salinities of individual ponds changeover the growingseasonas they melt out, evaporateand then re-freeze.The occurrenceof speciessuccessionin responseto such changes needsinvestigation.Also, therewere indications that different crustoselichenspecies,andpossibly moss species,exhibit different distribution pat- terns. No attempt has beenmade to distinguish them in the presentreport. These,and the distri- bution patterns of foliose and fi-utcoselichens, will beunderstoodonly whenwe can relatethem to micrometeorological data and chemical ana- lyses of their substrataand water supplies. Thedatacanalsoserveasa base-linefor moni- toring changesin vegetationover long periods. For instance,distribution patternscould alter in responseto an amelioration of climate or to a change in the extent or persistenceof sea-ice which would result in changesto the quantity of salt transferredto land. Additionally, an increase in human activity at these ice-free areascould result in damageto theplant communities.Know- ledge of distribution patterns can help in the assessmentof such effects and in the choice of areasrequiring specialprotection.
