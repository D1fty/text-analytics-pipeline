Abstract. The  invertebrate faunal composition  of moss- dom i na t ed  flushes near  the Canada  Glacier was, as in similar habitats in continental Antarctic regions, nu- merically dom i na t ed  by protozoa ,  rotifers, nematodes  and  tardigrades. Mites were of lesser abundance. Although collembola occur in the Tay l or  Valley, none  were found  at the study site. The  finding of a catenulid flatworm is significant as microturbellarians have only rarely been recorded from Antarctica. Nematode ,  tardigrade and  roti- fer densities recorded  were comparable  to those in other Antarctic regions. These groups were found  at a mean  depth  ranging from 5 to 10.83 mm  in the moss. A greater percentage of all groups were in the upper  5 mm  of moss cores in post-melt samples than  in pre-melt samples.

In the Antarctic region, in areas free of permanent  snow and ice, there is an abundan t  invertebrate fauna. Ar t hro-  pods, especially Collembola, dominate  the macroscopic  fauna and various microscopic invertebrates, including nematodes, tardigrades, mites and rotifers, are abundan t  (Block 1984). Ecological investigations on  these communities in- clude studies of the distribution, habitats and physiology of arthropods ,  and their interactions with the environment  (e.g. Block 1984, and  references therein; Usher and Booth  1984, 1986; Block 1985). Quantitative  studies of nema- todes, rotifers and tardigrades have been conducted  on Signy Island (e.g. Jennings 1979; Spaull 1973; Maslen 1981) and in the Vestfold Hills (Rounsevell 1981; Rounsev- ell and  Home  1986). Aquatic microfaunas have been described from the Vestfold Hills by Everitt (1981), from Signy Island by McInnes and  Ellis-Evans (1990), from melt ponds on the Ross Ice Shelf by Suren (1990) and at Schirmacher Oasis (Ingole and Parulekar  1990). During the austral summer  of 1989/90, we carried out a preliminary study of the invertebrates inhabiting bryo-

phyte-dominated  flushes at Canada  Glacier in the lower Tay l or  Valley, southern  Victoria Land. The  study concen- trated  on distribution and abundance  of animals in rela- tion to habitat  as indicated by plant species dominance  and location.

Site description

The  flushes lie within the Site of Special Scientific Interest (S.S.S.I) No. 12, located on the eastern margin of the lower part of the Canada  Glacier. The  study was carried out in accordance  with a New Zealand  D.S.I.R. permit regulating access to the S.S.S.I. The  site contains areas of rich plant growth associated with the summer melt runoff from the Canada  Glacier. The two principal areas of plant growth selected for study were along the eastern flank of the glacier, separated by Canada  Pond, and designated as the &quot;upper&quot;  flush and  &quot;lower&quot; flush as described in Schwarz et al. (1992). The  lower flush slopes downhill, northeast  from the glacier, toward  Canada  Pond  with an overall fall in elevation of 5.4 m. The flush is delimited by the peripheral extent of plant growth and  covers an area of around  7150m  z (130 m long and 55 m wide). The main water- course flowing on t o  the flush divides into two courses approximately  45 m from the glacier face, rejoining 30 m further downslope and narrowing  overall to a 10 m-wide band  draining into Canada  Pond. The  upper flush slopes uphill north  and  northwest of Canada  Pond  and is fed from the northern  lateral face of the glacier and an ice- cored lateral moraine. In late November  1989, melt water first began to flow on t o  the flushes and by early December  much  of the vegetation in lower lying areas was completely submerged. Fou r  ecological zones, based on  pattern  of water flow and plant distribution, were assigned to the lower flush (Schwarz et al. 1992). Zone  1: Area receiving earliest meltwater. Generally the lowest lying ground  dominated  by Nostoc spp. and  other Cyanobacteria, and Bryum argenteum. Zone  2: Receiving seepage meltwater during</pre>

Methods a) Microclimate

Moss and air temperatures were recorded using a &quot;Fluke&quot; digital thermometer with 0.1~ resolution. Recordings were made over four diel periods at 2 h intervals during November  and December 1989. The measurement site was in an area of B. aroenteum turf, on the lower flush, at an elevation of 3.8 m from Canada Pond. Air temperatures were measured 10 cm above the moss surface. Temper- atures in the moss turf were measured at depths of 5, 10 and 15 ram.

b)- Invertebrates

in each core were determined as described above. The most extensive sampling (14/15 November) was prior to meltwater flow across the flush (pre-melt), when invertebrates from one core per zone from each transect were counted. At this time, the moss and algal vegetation was in a freeze-dried condition. Animals were dormant but activity resumed within a few minutes of wetting core samples of vegetation in the field laboratory. Samples were also taken post-melt (8-10 December) after meltwater had been on the flush for 14 days. Most samples were assayed soon after collection in a field laboratory, although some were transported frozen to New Zealand for analysis. Each core was sectioned into three layers 5 mm thick, wetted and left at around 2~ for 1 h before counting. A 1 h emergence period was chosen after a preliminary series of hourly counts over 24 h indicated little increasein numbers after 1 h. Mean densities per core were calculated from 20 pre-melt and 16 post-melt cores and expressed as densities (numbers per square metre) to enable com- parisons with other studies. To determine if interzonal differences in animal densities were significant, pre-melt counts were analysed using the non-parametric Friedman test. If significant differences in densities were found between zones, multiple comparisons were carried out between zone pairs (Steel and Torrie 1960). The vertical distribution of rotifers, nematodes and tardigrades within the moss turf cores was calculated from counts of each 5 mm section of both pre- and post-melt cores. The vertical distribution in four samples from each zone is summarised using the mean depth

At least five core samples were obtained per transect for invertebrate population assays. The ~. 0 cores were extracted with a 1 cm diameter cork borer which was g&quot;

Core samples were teased out in a thin layer of water in a petri dish. ~&quot; 5 Animal counts were made in a perspex Bogorov chamber (channel width 10 ram) using a dissecting microscope (x  50 magnification). ~ o Rotifers, nematodes and tardigrades were identified to genus level using Dartnall and Hollowday (1985), Timm (1971) and Dastych

Mites were no t  observed  in the field bu t  were seen in samples  exam i ned  later in New  Zea l and ,  pre- sumab l y  being present  as eggs or  in a larval  state in the samples  and  thus  no t  no t ed  at the time of  field exam-  ination .  Mites were found  on l y  in samples  from  one  transect ,  in the encrus t ed  Pottia zone  t ha t  had  been  wetted  for up  to  10 days. Their  densities reached  23 animals  per  1 cm  core. A l t hough  the identification  of  the mites has no t  been  confirmed ,  S t r and t mann  et al. (1973) and  Block  (1985) have  repor t ed  Stereotydeus mollis from  the Canada  Glacier  flush. Co l l embo l a  were no t  observed  in either the upper  or  lower  flush bu t  have  been  recovered  from  ephe- meral  s t ream  courses  in the lower  Tay l o r  Valley, and  were recovered  from  samples  t aken  from  no r t h  facing slopes between  the Crescen t  and  Howa r d  Glaciers  on  the sou t h  side of  the valley.

Invertebrate abundance and distribution. Animals  were no t  active within  the flush pre-me l t  and  coun t s  from  samples  t aken  at this time are therefore  an  i nd i ca t i on  of  the po t en t i a l  i nocu l um  which  wou l d  become  active as soon  as free water  became  available. P r o t ozoa  were observed  bu t  no t  quantified. They  appeared  to  be present  in greater  numbe r s  t han  o t her  groups .  Pre-me l t  densities of  rotifers (Table 2) ranged  from  a max i mum  of  l 12x  103 m -2  in zone  2, to  a m i n i mum  of  66 x 10  3 m - 2  in zone  4. Pre-me l t  nema t ode  densities ranged  from  122 x 103 m - z  in zone  2 to 18 x 103 m -2  in zone  4. Ta r d i g r ade  coun t s  ranged  from  60 x 103 m -2  in zone  3 to  14 x l03 m -2  in zone  4. On l y  for nema t odes  were significant differences f ound  between  zones, with numbe r s  significantly lower  in zone  4 (encrus- ted Pottia) t han  in zones  2 and  3 (P &lt; 0.05).

Logistic constraints meant that insufficient samples could be taken  after meltwater began affecting the flush to enable a Friedman  test analysis. However, it is evident from Table 2 that there is a large increase in numbers  of both  rotifers and nematodes post-melt. Post-melt rotifer counts under- estimate numbers since, to avoid non-viable individuals, only mobile or feeding animals were counted. To  indicate the effect of counting all individuals, the inclusion of contracted individuals in two samples where Philodina dominated  brought  the counts from 40 and 48 individuals per core to 240 and 205 individuals respectively. The lower densities were used in analysis.

Vertical distribution of invertebrates. While there appeared to be no significant trends in rotifer densities with depth in pre-melt samples, nematodes were found deeper in zone 4 (driest) than in other zones. The  mean  depth  for all groups of animals ranged from 5 to 10.83 mm. In post melt samples, rotifers were evenly distributed with depth in zones 1-3 but were closer to the surface in zone 4. Nematodes  and tardigrades had  a shallower I) in all zones in post-melt samples than in pre-melt samples. In both  pre- and post-melt samples, tardigrades had a shallower mean depth in zone 4 than  in other zones. Table 3 summarises the percentage contribution  of each group of animals within each depth class. In the pre- melt samples there was little obvious difference between depths, although in zone 4 there were almost always fewer individuals in the deepest 5 mm  of the moss core. There were few nematodes, no rotifers and no tardigrades found in the deepest 5 mm  of zone 4 in post-melt samples. A greater percentage of all groups were in the upper 5 mm  in post-melt samples than in pre-melt samples.

Discussion

Despite the harshness of conditions in the Dry  Valleys, the fauna of the bryophyte  flushes is dominated  by microscop- ic cryptobiotic invertebrates and is similar to that of moss felts elsewhere in Antarctica (Block 1984). The  occurrence of a catenulid flatworm at the Canada  Glacier is a significant find since microturbellarians have rarely been recorded  from continental Antarctica. Dougherty  and Harris (1963) reported microturbellarians in freshwater bodies of Ross Island and Victoria Land, but  emphasized that while nearly all samples of wet algal felt they exam- ined contained populations of rotifers, nematodes and tardigrades, the occurrence of microturbellarians was sporadic. However, Ingole and Parulekar  (1990) reported turbellaria as being dominant  over tardigrada and  rotifera at Priyadarshani  Lake, Schirmacher oasis, and putative Turbellarian eggs have been identified from freshwater bodies in the Bunger Hills (D. Hay , personal communi- cation). Mites were collected from the Lake Fryxell area in 1972 (Strandtmann  et al. 1973), in 1980/81 (Greenfield and Wilson 1981), and in 1984/85 (Block 1985). Strandtmann  (personal communication) found mites to be present in some areas and absent in other apparently identical areas, as also found in this study. Tha t  mites emerged from the core samples only under l abora t ory  conditions in New  Zealand may  indicate that, for emergence from a larval state, they require a longer period of higher temperature  and humidity than they had been subjected to naturally at the time of sampling. The  absence of Collembola at the Canada  Glacier flush was also noted  by Greenfield and Wilson (1981) although they have been collected from northerly  facing slopes and ephemeral melt channels in the Taylor  Valley. Where collembolans have been found in Antarctica they are often concentrated under stones in areas apparently devoid of macroscopic vegetation, although at least microscopic algae and fungi are usually present. When  temperatures are sufficiently high, they may  become more active among  bare or lichen-covered rock surfaces or move into avail- able areas of vegetation (Janetschek 1967). Block (1985) reported that ar t hropod  activity in the Ross Island/ McMu r do  Dry  Valleys region of southern  Victoria Land was highest at microsites where both  vegetative growth and moisture were present. Our  results showed that there were lower numbers of tardigrades than  either rotifers or nematodes in both  pre-

Ou r  results conf i rm  t hose  of  o t her  studies which  showed  t ha t  the ma j or i t y  of  invertebrates  are usually  f ound  in the upper  1-3 cm  of  moss. Jenn i ngs  (1979) f ound  t ha t  70%  of  t ard i grades  occurred  within  the upper  3 cm  of  moss  on  Signy  Island ,  while Caldwell  (1981) f ound  the  ma j or i t y  of  nema t odes  to  be in the upper  1 cm. B r oady  (1979) no t ed  the presence  of  mos t  algae in a restricted  region  of  0 - 6  cm  down  the b r yophy t e  shoo t s  on  Signy  Island ,  while Usher  and  Boo t h  (1984) showed  t ha t  the surface 1 - 1 . 5cm  of  the moss  t urf  is the zone  where  virtually  all the p r i ma r y  p r oduc t i on  of  mosses  and  algae occurs. These  algae are po t en t i a l l y  a ma j o r  food  source  for  graz i ng  invertebrates .  The  mos t  abundan t  rotifers in the flush were bdelloids. Bdelloid  rotifers have  the ability t o  pass i n t o  a state of  anab i os i s  when  dried  and  may  rema i n  thus  for years. Upon  being  rewetted  they  resume  activity  and  are directly  ready  to  deposit  eggs. Pa r t henogene t i c  r ep r oduc t i on  of  bdelloid  rotifers enables  a rap i d  popu l a t i on  increase early  in the season  as soon  as free wa t er  is available  (Everitt 1981). While  no  quan t i t a t i ve  compa r i son  was  made  in this study ,  monogonon t i d  rotifers were mo r e  abundan t  in samples  t aken  later in the samp l i ng  period. We t t er  zones  of  the Fryxell  flush had  significantly higher  numbe r s  of  nema t odes  t han  the driest zone. A survey  of  terrestrial nema t odes  of  the M c Mu r do  Sound  region  by  Wha r t on  and  B r own  (1989) no t ed  t ha t  numbe r s  of  an i ma l s  varied  cons i derab l y  even in different samples  from  the same  general  area. In  general, algal samples  con t a i ned  grea t er  numbe r s  of  nema t odes  t han  moss  sam-  ples.
